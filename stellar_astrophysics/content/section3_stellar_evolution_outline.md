# Stellar Evolution Content

## Introduction
This section will cover the evolution of stars from the main sequence through various evolutionary stages, including:
- Post-main sequence evolution
- Red giant phase
- Horizontal branch
- Asymptotic giant branch
- Final stages (white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes)
- Supernovae and other stellar explosions

## Key Topics
1. Main sequence lifetime and evolution
2. Hydrogen shell burning
3. Helium flash in low-mass stars
4. Evolution of stars of different masses
5. Mass loss mechanisms
6. Planetary nebulae formation
7. Supernovae mechanisms (core-collapse and Type Ia)
8. Compact object formation
9. Nucleosynthesis during stellar evolution

## Mathematical Concepts
- Stellar evolution equations
- Evolutionary tracks on the H-R diagram
- Timescales for different evolutionary phases
- Mass-loss rates
- Supernova energetics

## Applications in Astronomy
- Stellar population studies
- Galactic chemical evolution
- Age dating of stellar clusters
- Supernova cosmology
- Gravitational wave sources

## Interactive Elements
