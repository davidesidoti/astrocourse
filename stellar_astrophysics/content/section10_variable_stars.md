# Variable Stars and Binary Systems

## Introduction

Stars are not the static, unchanging points of light they appear to be to the naked eye. Many stars exhibit variations in brightness, temperature, or other observable properties over time. These variable stars provide crucial insights into stellar physics that cannot be obtained from studying constant stars alone. Similarly, binary star systems—where two stars orbit a common center of mass—offer unique opportunities to directly measure fundamental stellar properties and study stellar interactions.

In this section, we will explore the diverse world of variable stars and binary systems. We will examine the physical mechanisms that cause stellar variability, the different types of variable stars and their classification, and the methods used to study them. We will also investigate binary star systems, their evolution, and the fascinating phenomena that occur when stars interact with each other.

Understanding variable stars and binary systems is essential for several reasons. Variable stars like Cepheids and RR Lyrae stars serve as "standard candles" for measuring cosmic distances. Eclipsing binaries allow direct determination of stellar masses and radii. Asteroseismology—the study of stellar oscillations—provides a way to probe stellar interiors. Furthermore, interacting binaries are responsible for some of the most energetic phenomena in the universe, including type Ia supernovae, X-ray binaries, and gravitational wave sources.

## Binary Star Systems

### Classification and Basic Properties

Binary star systems are extremely common in our galaxy, with more than half of all stars existing in binary or multiple systems:

1. **Classification by Observational Method**:
   - Visual binaries: Both stars can be resolved through telescopes
   - Spectroscopic binaries: Detected through periodic Doppler shifts in spectral lines
   - Eclipsing binaries: One star periodically passes in front of the other, causing brightness variations
   - Astrometric binaries: Detected through the wobble of a visible star due to an unseen companion
   - Interferometric binaries: Resolved using interferometric techniques

2. **Classification by Separation**:
   - Wide binaries: Separation > 1000 AU, negligible interaction
   - Intermediate binaries: Separation 10-1000 AU, minimal interaction
   - Close binaries: Separation < 10 AU, significant gravitational interaction
   - Contact binaries: Stars share a common envelope

3. **Orbital Parameters**:
   - Semi-major axis (a): Average separation between stars
   - Eccentricity (e): Measure of how elliptical the orbit is
   - Orbital period (P): Time for one complete orbit
   - Inclination (i): Angle between orbital plane and plane of sky
   - Relation between period and semi-major axis (Kepler's Third Law):
     P² = 4π²a³/G(M₁ + M₂)

4. **Mass Determination**:
   - Visual binaries: a³/P² = (M₁ + M₂)/4π²
   - Spectroscopic binaries: Mass function f(M) = (M₂sin i)³/(M₁ + M₂)²
   - Eclipsing binaries: Complete solution possible with radial velocities and light curve

### Binary Star Formation and Evolution

Binary stars can form through several mechanisms and follow complex evolutionary paths:

1. **Formation Mechanisms**:
   - Fragmentation of molecular cloud cores during collapse
   - Disk fragmentation during protostellar phase
   - Capture (rare in dense stellar environments)
   - Initial binary fraction appears to be high (>50%)
   - Binary frequency increases with primary star mass

2. **Evolution of Detached Binaries**:
   - Stars evolve independently if separation is large
   - More massive star evolves faster, becomes a giant first
   - When separation is sufficient, both stars can evolve into compact objects without interaction

3. **Roche Lobe and Critical Surfaces**:
   - Roche lobe: Region around a star where material is gravitationally bound to that star
   - L₁ (inner Lagrangian point): Point between stars where gravitational forces balance
   - Roche lobe overflow occurs when a star expands beyond its Roche lobe
   - Approximate Roche lobe radius:
     R_L ≈ 0.49a[q²/³/(1+q²/³)]
     where q = M₁/M₂ is the mass ratio

4. **Binary Evolution Pathways**:
   - Stable mass transfer: Accretor can accommodate transferred material
   - Unstable mass transfer: Leads to common envelope phase
   - Final outcomes depend on initial masses and separations:
     - Two white dwarfs
     - White dwarf + neutron star
     - Two neutron stars
     - Black hole + neutron star
     - Two black holes

### Mass Transfer and Accretion

When stars in close binaries begin to interact, complex mass transfer processes occur:

1. **Types of Mass Transfer**:
   - Case A: Donor star is on main sequence
   - Case B: Donor star is in post-main sequence but pre-helium ignition
   - Case C: Donor star has already ignited helium
   - Conservative vs. non-conservative transfer (whether mass and angular momentum are conserved)

2. **Accretion Processes**:
   - Direct impact: Material falls directly onto companion
   - Disk accretion: Material forms a disk due to angular momentum
   - Accretion efficiency: ε = GM/Rc² (typically 0.1-0.2 for neutron stars and black holes)
   - Accretion luminosity: L_acc = εṀc²

3. **Accretion Disk Physics**:
   - Viscosity causes angular momentum transport outward, mass transport inward
   - Temperature profile: T(r) ∝ r^(-3/4)
   - Disk instability model explains dwarf nova outbursts
   - Magnetohydrodynamic processes important for angular momentum transport

4. **Observational Signatures**:
   - UV excess from hot spots and accretion disks
   - Emission lines from heated gas
   - X-ray emission from compact object accretors
   - Flickering and quasi-periodic oscillations
   - Jets and outflows in some systems

### Common Envelope Evolution

Common envelope evolution represents a critical, short-lived phase in binary evolution:

1. **Formation Mechanism**:
   - Unstable mass transfer leads to runaway process
   - Accretor cannot accommodate transferred material
   - Transferred material engulfs both stars
   - Timescale: dynamical (~years) rather than thermal or nuclear

2. **Inspiral Process**:
   - Binary orbit decays due to drag forces within envelope
   - Orbital energy transferred to envelope
   - Envelope heated and potentially ejected
   - Final separation much smaller than initial separation

3. **Outcomes**:
   - Successful ejection: Close binary remains (e.g., cataclysmic variable progenitor)
   - Incomplete ejection: Stars merge completely
   - Energy balance determines outcome:
     αCE × (Ebind - Eth) = Eorb,i - Eorb,f
     where αCE is the efficiency parameter

4. **Observational Evidence**:
   - Short-period binaries containing at least one compact object
   - Planetary nebulae with close binary central stars
   - Post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs)
   - Luminous red novae may be common envelope ejection events

### Interacting Binary Systems

Various types of interacting binary systems exhibit fascinating phenomena:

1. **Algol-type Binaries**:
   - Semi-detached systems with mass transfer
   - Mass ratio reversal: Less massive star is more evolved

   - Periods typically 1-10 days

2. **Cataclysmic Variables (CVs)**:
   - White dwarf accreting from low-mass companion
   - Orbital periods typically 1-10 hours
   - Subtypes:
     - Dwarf novae: Periodic outbursts from disk instability
     - Classical novae: Thermonuclear explosions on white dwarf surface
     - Polars: Strong magnetic fields prevent disk formation
     - Intermediate polars: Partial disk formation

3. **X-ray Binaries**:
   - Neutron star or black hole accreting from companion
   - High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs): Massive OB star companion
   - Low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs): Low-mass companion
   - Transient vs. persistent sources
   - X-ray bursters: Thermonuclear flashes on neutron star surface

4. **Exotic Systems**:
   - Double degenerate binaries (two compact objects)
   - Millisecond pulsars: "Recycled" by accretion
   - Gravitational wave sources (compact object mergers)
   - Symbiotic stars: White dwarf + red giant
   - Be/X-ray binaries: Neutron star + Be star with circumstellar disk

## Eclipsing Binary Stars

### Light Curves and Analysis

Eclipsing binaries provide the most direct measurements of stellar parameters:

1. **Light Curve Morphology**:
   - Primary eclipse: Deeper minimum when brighter star is eclipsed
   - Secondary eclipse: Shallower minimum when fainter star is eclipsed
   - Contact points: Times when eclipses begin and end
   - Eclipse depth: Related to surface brightness ratio and relative sizes
   - Out-of-eclipse variations: Due to reflection effect, ellipsoidal variations, spots

2. **Classification**:
   - EA (Algol-type): Well-defined beginnings and ends of eclipses

   - Semi-amplitude:
     K₁ = (2πa₁sin i)/(P√(1-e²))
   - Mass function:
     f(m) = (m₂sin i)³/(m₁+m₂)² = P·K₁³(1-e²)^(3/2)/(2πG)

3. **Roche Geometry**:
   - Effective potential: Φ = -GM₁/r₁ - GM₂/r₂ - ½Ω²(x² + y²)
   - Critical surfaces defined by equipotentials
   - Volume-equivalent Roche lobe radius approximation:
     R_L/a ≈ 0.49q^(2/3)/[0.6q^(2/3) + ln(1+q^(1/3))]
     where q = M₁/M₂

4. **Mass Transfer Rate**:

### Stellar Pulsation Theory

The mathematics of stellar pulsations involves solving the fluid equations with perturbations:

1. **Linear Adiabatic Wave Equation**:
   - For radial pulsations:
     d²ξ/dr² + [4π·ρ·ω²/c_s² - g·d(ln ρ)/dr]·ξ = 0
   - Where ξ is displacement, c_s is sound speed, g is gravity
   - Boundary conditions: ξ finite at center, δP = 0 at surface
   - Eigenvalue problem yields discrete frequencies

2. **Non-radial Oscillations**:
   - Displacement vector: ξ = ξ_r·Y_l^m·e_r + ξ_h·∇_h·Y_l^m
   - Governing equations separate into radial and angular parts
   - Angular part: Spherical harmonics Y_l^m(θ,φ)
   - Radial part: System of differential equations

3. **Asymptotic Theory**:
   - For p-modes (high n): ν_n,l ≈ Δν(n + l/2 + ε)
   - For g-modes (high n): P_n,l ≈ ΔP_l·n + ε_g
   - Large frequency separation: Δν = (2∫_0^R dr/c_s)⁻¹
   - Period spacing: ΔP_l = 2π²/(l(l+1))^(1/2) · (∫N·dr/r)⁻¹
   - Where N is the Brunt-Väisälä frequency

4. **Driving Mechanisms**:
   - κ-mechanism: (∂κ/∂T)_ρ > 0 in partial ionization zones
   - Work integral: W = ∮P·dV over cycle
   - Instability when W > 0
   - Growth rate: η = W/(2πE_0) where E_0 is total energy

   - Reflection effect: Heating of facing hemispheres
   - Numerical integration over visible surface elements

3. **Radial Velocity Analysis**:
   - Combined with light curves for complete solution
   - Mass ratio: q = m₂/m₁ = K₁/K₂
   - Individual masses: m₁sin³i = P(K₁+K₂)²K₂/(2πG)
   - Absolute dimensions require inclination from light curve

4. **Statistical Methods**:
   - Least squares fitting
   - Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
   - Genetic algorithms
   - Parameter correlations and degeneracies
   - Error estimation through bootstrapping or Bayesian analysis

### Asteroseismic Inversion

The mathematical techniques for inferring stellar structure from oscillation frequencies:

1. **Forward Problem**:
   - Calculate theoretical frequencies for a given stellar model
   - Frequency differences: δω_i = ω_i^obs - ω_i^model
   - Relate to structure differences through variational principle
   - Kernels K relate structure differences to frequency differences

2. **Inverse Problem**:
   - Linear relation: δω_i = ∫K_i(r)·δf(r)·dr + ε_i
   - Where δf represents structure difference (e.g., sound speed)
   - Ill-posed problem requiring regularization
   - Methods: Regularized Least Squares (RLS), Optimally Localized Averages (OLA)

3. **Asymptotic Relations**:
   - Large separation: Δν ≈ (2∫_0^R dr/c_s)⁻¹
   - Small separation: δν_l,l+2 ≈ -(4l+6)Δν/(4π²ν_n,l)·∫_0^R (dc/dr)(dr/r)
   - Period spacing for g-modes: ΔP = 2π²/(√(l(l+1)))·(∫N·dr/r)⁻¹
   - Directly relate to stellar structure

4. **Ensemble Asteroseismology**:
   - Grid-based modeling
   - Bayesian parameter estimation
   - Scaling relations:
     - Δν ∝ ρ^(1/2) ∝ M^(1/2)·R^(-3/2)
     - ν_max ∝ g·T_eff^(-1/2) ∝ M·R^(-2)·T_eff^(-1/2)
   - Precision: 3-5% in mass and radius, 10-15% in age

## Practical Applications and Exercises

   - Radial velocity semi-amplitudes: K₁ = 62 km/s, K₂ = 85 km/s
   - Circular orbit (e = 0)
   - No eclipses observed

2. **Mass Ratio Calculation**:
   - q = m₂/m₁ = K₁/K₂ = 62/85 = 0.73

3. **Minimum Masses**:
   - m₁sin³i = P(K₁+K₂)²K₂/(2πG)
   - = (5.2 days)(62+85)²(85)/(2π·G) = 2.43 M☉·sin³i
   - m₂sin³i = P(K₁+K₂)²K₁/(2πG)
   - = (5.2 days)(62+85)²(62)/(2π·G) = 1.77 M☉·sin³i

4. **Orbital Separation**:
   - a·sin i = P(K₁+K₂)/(2π)
   - = (5.2 days)(62+85)/(2π) = 12.7 R☉·sin i
   - Individual semi-major axes:
     - a₁·sin i = P·K₁/(2π) = 4.5 R☉·sin i
     - a₂·sin i = P·K₂/(2π) = 6.2 R☉·sin i

   - Secondary eclipse depth: 0.12 magnitudes (10% flux reduction)
   - Eclipse durations: primary 5.2 hours, secondary 4.8 hours
   - Circular orbit assumed

2. **Relative Radii Estimation**:
   - For circular orbit with central eclipse:
     - r₁ + r₂ = (π·D·a)/(P) where D is eclipse duration
     - (r₁ + r₂)/a = π·(5.2/24)/(2.87) = 0.24
   - Flux ratio: F₂/F₁ = 0.2 (from eclipse depths)
   - Surface brightness ratio: J₂/J₁ = (F₂/F₁)·(R₁/R₂)²

3. **Inclination Estimation**:
   - For total eclipse: cos i ≤ (r₁-r₂)/a
   - For partial eclipse: cos i = [(r₁+r₂)² - (Δt·2π·a/P)²]^(1/2)/a
   - Where Δt is eclipse duration
   - Calculated inclination: i ≈ 85°

4. **Temperature Estimation**:
   - Surface brightness ratio related to temperature: J₂/J₁ ≈ (T₂/T₁)⁴
   - If T₁ = 10,000 K and J₂/J₁ = 0.3, then T₂ ≈ 7,100 K

### Cepheid Variable Analysis

1. **Problem Setup**:
   - Cepheid with period P = 10.15 days
   - Apparent magnitude range: 6.2 to 7.1
   - Located in a galaxy with known distance modulus μ = 25.0

2. **Absolute Magnitude Calculation**:
   - Period-luminosity relation: M_V = -2.43(log P - 1) - 4.05
   - M_V = -2.43(log 10.15 - 1) - 4.05 = -5.53
   - Average apparent magnitude: 6.65
   - Distance modulus: μ = m - M = 25.0
   - Therefore M = 6.65 - 25.0 = -18.35
   - This is for the galaxy; the Cepheid is at M_V = -5.53

3. **Physical Parameters Estimation**:
   - Mass-luminosity-period relation: log(M/M☉) ≈ 0.46 log P + 0.10
   - Mass estimate: M ≈ 7.2 M☉
   - Radius from period-radius relation: log(R/R☉) ≈ 0.68 log P + 1.10
   - Radius estimate: R ≈ 70 R☉
   - Temperature from luminosity and radius: T_eff ≈ 5,600 K

4. **Pulsation Analysis**:
   - Period change rate: Ṗ/P ≈ 10⁻⁶ per year (typical value)
   - Crossing number from period change: positive Ṗ indicates second or third crossing
   - Fourier decomposition parameters can further constrain evolutionary state

   - Effective temperature T_eff = 6100 K
   - Solar values: Δν_☉ = 135 μHz, ν_max,☉ = 3100 μHz, T_eff,☉ = 5777 K

2. **Scaling Relations Application**:
   - Mass: M/M_☉ = (ν_max/ν_max,☉)³ · (Δν/Δν_☉)⁻⁴ · (T_eff/T_eff,☉)^(3/2)
   - M/M_☉ = (2300/3100)³ · (120/135)⁻⁴ · (6100/5777)^(3/2) ≈ 1.15
   - Radius: R/R_☉ = (ν_max/ν_max,☉) · (Δν/Δν_☉)⁻² · (T_eff/T_eff,☉)^(1/2)
   - R/R_☉ = (2300/3100) · (120/135)⁻² · (6100/5777)^(1/2) ≈ 1.25
   - Surface gravity: log g = log g_☉ + log(ν_max/ν_max,☉) - log(T_eff/T_eff,☉)/2
   - log g ≈ 4.34 (g in cm/s²)

3. **Age Estimation**:
   - Small frequency separation δν_02 ≈ 8 μHz
   - C-D diagram position: δν_02/Δν ≈ 0.067
