## Known Issues/Challenges

- The interactive elements require JavaScript libraries (D3.js, Three.js) which add to page load time
- Need to ensure all interactive elements work well on different screen sizes and devices
- Need to integrate the interactive elements with the main course navigation
- The Orbit Simulator is computationally intensive and may run slowly on older devices
