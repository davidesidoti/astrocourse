# AstroCourse Project Progress

## Completed Features/Tasks

### Content Development
- âœ… Created detailed lesson content for Section 1: Introduction
- âœ… Created detailed lesson content for Section 2: Conceptual Foundation
- âœ… Created detailed lesson content for Section 3: Mathematical Framework
- âœ… Created detailed lesson content for Section 4: Worked Examples
- âœ… Created detailed lesson content for Section 5: Practice Problems
- âœ… Created detailed lesson content for Section 6: Summary and Connections

### Interactive Elements
- âœ… Implemented Trigonometric Function Explorer
  - Interactive visualization of sine, cosine, and tangent functions
  - Adjustable parameters (amplitude, frequency, phase shift, vertical shift)
  - Real-time equation display
  - Function properties and astronomical applications
- âœ… Implemented Coordinate System Transformer
  - Conversion between multiple coordinate systems (Cartesian, Polar, Spherical)
  - Support for astronomical coordinate systems (Equatorial, Horizontal, Ecliptic, Galactic)
  - 3D visualization of coordinates
  - Comprehensive transformation formulas

## Current Work in Progress

- ðŸ”„ Triangle Calculator
  - Will allow solving triangles with various input combinations
  - Will include both plane and spherical triangles
  - Will demonstrate applications in astronomical distance calculations

## Known Issues/Challenges

- The Coordinate System Transformer requires Three.js library which adds to page load time
- Need to ensure all interactive elements work well on different screen sizes and devices
- Need to integrate the interactive elements with the main course navigation

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Triangle Calculator interactive element
2. Implement the Vector Operations Visualizer
3. Implement the Orbit Simulator
4. Add Math Helper sidebars for key concepts
5. Create visual learning aids for complex concepts
6. Integrate all interactive elements with the main course structure
7. Test all components for usability and responsiveness
8. Add comprehensive documentation for each interactive element

## Recent Updates

**March 22, 2025**
