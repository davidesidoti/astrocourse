## Known Issues/Challenges

- The interactive elements require JavaScript libraries (D3.js, Three.js) which add to page load time
- Need to ensure all interactive elements work well on different screen sizes and devices
- Need to integrate the interactive elements with the main course navigation
- The Orbit Simulator is computationally intensive and may run slowly on older devices

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete the Trigonometry and Geometry module (COMPLETED)
2. Begin development of the Calculus module
   - Create detailed lesson content for all sections
   - Implement interactive elements (Derivative Explorer, Integral Visualizer, etc.)
3. Begin development of the Physics module
   - Create detailed lesson content for all sections
   - Implement interactive elements (Force Simulator, Wave Propagation Visualizer, etc.)
4. Add Math Helper sidebars for key concepts across all modules
5. Create visual learning aids for complex concepts
6. Integrate all interactive elements with the main course structure
7. Test all components for usability and responsiveness
8. Add comprehensive documentation for each interactive element
9. Develop assessment tools and quizzes for each module
