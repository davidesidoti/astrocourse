# Black Hole Physics Module Progress

## Recent Updates
- Completed all six remaining sections of the Black Hole Physics Module:
  - Section 4: Rotating Black Holes and the Kerr Metric
  - Section 5: Black Hole Thermodynamics and Hawking Radiation
  - Section 6: Accretion Disks and Relativistic Jets
  - Section 7: Recent Discoveries and Observations
  - Section 8: Common Misconceptions
  - Section 9: Black Hole Information Paradox
- Created three interactive visualizations:
