# Event Horizons and Singularities

## Introduction to Black Holes

Black holes represent one of the most fascinating and extreme predictions of Einstein's theory of general relativity. These extraordinary cosmic objects are regions of spacetime where gravity is so intense that nothing—not even light—can escape once it passes a boundary known as the event horizon. Despite their seemingly exotic nature, black holes are now understood to be common features of our universe, with millions or even billions residing in our galaxy alone.

At their core, black holes are remarkably simple objects that can be completely described by just three parameters: mass, angular momentum (spin), and electric charge (though astrophysical black holes are expected to have negligible charge). This property, known as the "no-hair theorem," stands in stark contrast to the complexity of other astronomical objects like stars and planets, which require numerous parameters to characterize fully.

The study of black holes sits at the intersection of general relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and astrophysics. They serve as cosmic laboratories for testing our most fundamental physical theories under extreme conditions that cannot be replicated on Earth. From the supermassive black holes that govern galactic evolution to the stellar-mass black holes that represent the final evolutionary stage of massive stars, these objects play crucial roles throughout the cosmos.

In this section, we will explore the fundamental concepts of event horizons and singularities, the defining features of black holes. We will examine their theoretical foundations, mathematical descriptions, and the observational evidence that has transformed black holes from theoretical curiosities to established astrophysical entities.

## Historical Development of Black Hole Theory

The concept of an object so massive that light cannot escape has a surprisingly long history, predating Einstein's theory of general relativity by more than a century:

1. **Newtonian Precursors (1783-1796)**:
   - John Michell (1783) and Pierre-Simon Laplace (1796) independently proposed the concept of "dark stars"—objects so massive that their escape velocity would exceed the speed of light
   - Using Newtonian mechanics and the corpuscular theory of light, they calculated that a star with the same density as the Sun but 500 times its radius would trap light
   - These ideas were largely forgotten as the wave theory of light gained acceptance

2. **General Relativity and the Schwarzschild Solution (1915-1916)**:
   - Einstein published his general theory of relativity in 1915, describing gravity as the curvature of spacetime
   - Karl Schwarzschild found the first exact solution to Einstein's field equations in 1916, describing the spacetime geometry around a non-rotating, spherically symmetric mass
   - The Schwarzschild solution contained a peculiar feature: a "singularity" at what would later be called the Schwarzschild radius

3. **Physical Interpretation (1920s-1960s)**:
   - The nature of the Schwarzschild "singularity" was debated for decades
   - In 1939, Robert Oppenheimer and Hartland Snyder calculated that a sufficiently massive star could collapse to form what we now call a black hole
   - The term "black hole" was coined by John Wheeler in 1967, replacing the earlier, more cumbersome terms like "gravitationally completely collapsed object"
   - Roger Penrose and Stephen Hawking developed mathematical theorems about singularities in the 1960s and 1970s

4. **Golden Age of Black Hole Theory (1960s-1970s)**:
   - Roy Kerr discovered the solution for rotating black holes in 1963
   - The four laws of black hole mechanics were formulated by Bardeen, Carter, and Hawking in 1973
   - Hawking radiation was predicted in 1974, suggesting that black holes are not completely black but emit thermal radiation
   - The connection between black hole physics and thermodynamics was established

5. **Observational Era (1990s-Present)**:
   - Indirect evidence for black holes accumulated through observations of X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei
   - The first direct detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes by LIGO in 2015 provided definitive evidence for their existence
   - The Event Horizon Telescope captured the first image of a black hole's shadow in 2019, visualizing the supermassive black hole at the center of galaxy M87

This historical progression demonstrates how black holes evolved from a theoretical curiosity to a central concept in modern astrophysics, with their existence now firmly established through multiple independent lines of evidence.

## Event Horizons: Definition and Properties

The event horizon is the defining feature of a black hole—a boundary in spacetime beyond which events cannot affect an outside observer:

1. **Formal Definition**:
   - The event horizon is a null hypersurface in spacetime that marks the boundary of the black hole region
   - It is the locus of points from which light rays cannot escape to infinity
   - Mathematically, it is defined as the boundary of the causal past of future null infinity
   - For a Schwarzschild (non-rotating) black hole, the event horizon is located at the Schwarzschild radius: r_s = 2GM/c²

2. **Key Properties**:
   - One-way membrane: Matter and radiation can fall in, but nothing can come out
   - Locally undetectable: An observer crossing the event horizon would not notice any special local physical effects
   - Global rather than local: The event horizon is defined by the global causal structure of spacetime
   - Teleological nature: The location of the event horizon depends on the entire future history of spacetime
   - Area theorem: Under classical physics, the area of the event horizon never decreases (analogous to entropy)

3. **Horizon Types and Variations**:
   - Event horizon: The absolute horizon defined by global causal structure
   - Apparent horizon: A locally defined surface where outgoing light rays are momentarily stationary
   - Killing horizon: A surface where a Killing vector field becomes null
   - Isolated horizon: A generalization for equilibrium situations
   - Dynamical horizon: A generalization for evolving black holes

4. **Horizon Geometry**:
   - Schwarzschild black hole: Spherically symmetric horizon
   - Kerr black hole: Oblate spheroid due to rotation
   - Area of a Schwarzschild horizon: A = 4πr_s² = 16πG²M²/c⁴
   - Area of a Kerr horizon: A = 8πGM²/c⁴ [1 + √(1 - a²)]
     where a = Jc/GM² is the dimensionless spin parameter

5. **Physical Significance**:
   - Information barrier: Information about events inside the horizon cannot reach outside observers
   - Thermodynamic entity: The horizon area is proportional to the black hole's entropy
   - Quantum effects: Hawking radiation is produced near the horizon due to quantum field effects
   - Gravitational time dilation: Time appears to stop for an outside observer watching an object approach the horizon

The event horizon represents a point of no return, but contrary to popular belief, there is nothing locally special about crossing this boundary. An observer falling into a black hole would not experience any dramatic physical effects when crossing the horizon itself—the extreme tidal forces would be felt closer to the singularity.

## Singularities: Nature and Theoretical Implications

At the heart of a black hole lies a singularity—a point where our current physical theories break down:

1. **Mathematical Definition**:
   - A singularity is a point where the spacetime curvature becomes infinite
   - Technically, it is a point where the spacetime manifold is geodesically incomplete
   - For a Schwarzschild black hole, the singularity is located at r = 0
   - The Riemann curvature tensor diverges as one approaches the singularity

2. **Types of Singularities**:
   - Spacelike singularity: Found in Schwarzschild black holes, unavoidable once inside the horizon
   - Timelike singularity: Found in Kerr and Reissner-Nordström black holes, theoretically avoidable
   - Naked singularity: A singularity not hidden behind an event horizon (theoretically possible but likely forbidden)
   - Conical singularity: A milder form found in certain spacetimes (e.g., cosmic strings)
   - BKL singularity: Characterized by chaotic, oscillatory behavior as it is approached

3. **Physical Implications**:
   - Breakdown of general relativity: Infinite curvature signals the failure of classical general relativity
   - Quantum gravity regime: A complete theory of quantum gravity is needed to describe the singularity
   - Tidal forces: An observer approaching the singularity would experience infinite tidal forces
   - Destruction of information: Classical theory suggests information is lost at the singularity
   - End of time: For an observer falling into a Schwarzschild black hole, the singularity represents the end of their worldline

4. **Theoretical Perspectives**:
   - Classical view: Singularities are genuine features of spacetime in general relativity
   - Quantum view: Singularities are likely resolved by quantum gravity effects
   - Loop quantum gravity: Suggests singularities are replaced by a "bounce"
   - String theory: Indicates singularities might be smoothed out by stringy effects
   - Holographic principle: Suggests a duality between the singularity and horizon physics

5. **Observational Consequences**:
   - Singularities cannot be directly observed due to the event horizon
   - Indirect effects might be detectable through gravitational waves
   - Quantum effects near singularities might leave imprints on Hawking radiation
   - The resolution of singularities might affect black hole evaporation

Singularities represent the ultimate breakdown of our current understanding of physics. While general relativity predicts their existence, most physicists believe they are artifacts of applying classical theory beyond its domain of validity. A complete theory of quantum gravity is expected to resolve these singularities, replacing them with something more physically reasonable, though still extreme.

## Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis

The cosmic censorship hypothesis addresses one of the most profound questions in black hole physics: Are singularities always hidden behind event horizons?

1. **Formulations**:
   - Weak cosmic censorship (Penrose, 1969): Singularities formed by gravitational collapse are always hidden behind event horizons
   - Strong cosmic censorship: Timelike singularities are not visible even from inside the event horizon
   - Mathematical statement: Complete null infinity is always visible to distant observers (no causal disconnection)

2. **Theoretical Motivation**:
   - Predictability of physics: Naked singularities would undermine the predictive power of general relativity
   - Causality protection: Naked singularities could allow information to propagate from regions where physics breaks down
   - Quantum gravity boundary: Confines regions requiring quantum gravity to inside black holes
   - Consistency with the second law of thermodynamics: Relates to the area increase theorem

3. **Status and Evidence**:
   - No mathematical proof exists for the general case
   - Proven in certain symmetric situations and for specific types of matter
   - Numerical simulations support the hypothesis in most realistic scenarios
   - Some potential counterexamples have been proposed but remain controversial
   - Quantum effects might allow violations in principle but suppress them in practice

4. **Potential Counterexamples**:
   - Kerr black holes with a > M (over-spinning)
   - Reissner-Nordström black holes with Q > M (over-charging)
   - Certain types of gravitational collapse with special initial conditions
   - Ultra-high energy particle collisions
   - Evaporating black holes in their final stages

5. **Implications**:
   - If true: General relativity remains predictive for all observable phenomena
   - If false: New physics beyond general relativity would be needed to describe naked singularities
   - Observational signatures: Naked singularities might produce distinctive gravitational wave or electromagnetic signals
   - Connection to quantum gravity: The resolution may depend on quantum gravitational effects

The cosmic censorship hypothesis remains one of the most important unresolved conjectures in theoretical physics. While most physicists believe some version of it is correct, a definitive proof remains elusive. The hypothesis plays a crucial role in our understanding of black holes and the limits of classical general relativity.

## Causal Structure and Light Cones

The causal structure of spacetime around black holes reveals how gravity fundamentally alters the flow of time and the propagation of light:

1. **Light Cones in Flat Spacetime**:
   - Light cone: The set of all possible paths that light could take through spacetime from a given event
   - Future light cone: All events that can be influenced by the given event
   - Past light cone: All events that could have influenced the given event
   - Timelike separation: Events that can be connected by a massive particle
   - Spacelike separation: Events that cannot causally influence each other

2. **Light Cones Near Black Holes**:
   - Gravitational lensing: Light cones bend due to spacetime curvature
   - Frame dragging: Light cones twist in the direction of black hole rotation
   - Light cone tilting: As one approaches the event horizon, future light cones tilt increasingly inward
   - At the horizon: Future light cones tilt completely inward, making outward paths impossible
   - Inside the horizon: All future-directed paths lead to the singularity

3. **Penrose Diagrams**:
   - Conformal compactification: Technique to represent infinite spacetime on a finite diagram
   - Schwarzschild black hole diagram: Shows the causal structure including event horizon and singularity
   - Kerr black hole diagram: More complex, showing inner and outer horizons
   - Eternal black hole: Contains two asymptotically flat regions connected by an Einstein-Rosen bridge
   - Forming black hole: Shows the horizon developing from gravitational collapse

4. **Causal Boundaries**:
   - Event horizon: Boundary of the region from which signals cannot escape to infinity
   - Cauchy horizon: Boundary beyond which initial data no longer uniquely determines the future
   - Ergosphere: Region where frame-dragging makes it impossible to remain stationary
   - Photon sphere: Surface where photons can orbit the black hole in unstable circular orbits
   - Innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO): Closest stable orbit for massive particles

5. **Implications for Observers**:
   - External observer: Never sees an object cross the horizon (due to infinite redshift)
   - Infalling observer: Crosses the horizon in finite proper time without noticing anything special locally
   - Inside the horizon: All possible future paths lead to the singularity
   - Causality violation: Certain black hole solutions (e.g., maximally extended Kerr) contain closed timelike curves
   - Information paradox: Relates to the apparent destruction of information at the singularity

Understanding the causal structure of black hole spacetimes is essential for grasping their fundamental nature. The bending and tilting of light cones visualize how black holes warp the fabric of spacetime, creating regions from which escape is impossible according to classical general relativity.

## Mathematical Description of Event Horizons

The precise mathematical characterization of event horizons reveals their geometric and physical properties:

1. **Metric Formulation**:
   - Schwarzschild metric (non-rotating black hole):
     ds² = -(1-2GM/rc²)c²dt² + (1-2GM/rc²)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)
   - Event horizon located at r = 2GM/c² where g₀₀ = 0
   - Kerr metric (rotating black hole) in Boyer-Lindquist coordinates:
     ds² = -(1-2GMr/ρ²c²)c²dt² - (4GMar sin²θ/ρ²c)dtdφ + (ρ²/Δ)dr² + ρ²dθ² + (r²+a²+2GMa²r sin²θ/ρ²c²)sin²θ dφ²
     where ρ² = r² + a²cos²θ and Δ = r² - 2GMr/c² + a²
   - Kerr horizons at r = GM/c² ± √((GM/c²)² - a²)

2. **Null Surface Characterization**:
   - Event horizon is a null hypersurface: g^μν(∂_μf)(∂_νf) = 0 for f = r - r_h
   - Normal vector to the horizon is null: n_μn^μ = 0
   - Generators of the horizon are null geodesics
   - Surface gravity κ defined by ξ^μ∇_μξ^ν = κξ^ν where ξ^μ is the horizon Killing vector
   - For Schwarzschild: κ = c⁴/4GM

3. **Area and Entropy**:
   - Horizon area for Schwarzschild: A = 4πr_s² = 16πG²M²/c⁴
   - Horizon area for Kerr: A = 8πGM²/c⁴[1 + √(1 - a²)]
   - Bekenstein-Hawking entropy: S = kA/4ℓ_P² where ℓ_P is the Planck length
   - First law of black hole mechanics: dM = (κ/8πG)dA + ΩdJ + ΦdQ
   - Area increase theorem: δA ≥ 0 in any classical process

4. **Horizon Dynamics**:
   - Membrane paradigm: Horizon behaves like a viscous fluid membrane
   - Tidal deformation: Characterized by horizon shear σ_ab and expansion θ
   - Damped oscillations: Characterized by quasinormal modes
   - Horizon evolution equation: dA/dt = ∫(θ²/8π)dA ≥ 0
   - Numerical relativity: Simulations of horizon dynamics during black hole mergers

5. **Quantum Aspects**:
   - Hawking temperature: T = ℏκ/2πk_B
   - For Schwarzschild: T = ℏc³/8πGMk_B
   - Vacuum polarization near horizon creates particle pairs
   - Unruh effect: Accelerated observers detect thermal radiation
   - Quantum fluctuations of the horizon: Δr ~ ℓ_P

The mathematical description of event horizons connects abstract geometric concepts to physical observables. While the classical picture treats the horizon as a smooth, well-defined surface, quantum effects suggest a more complex reality where the horizon has thickness, temperature, and microscopic degrees of freedom.

## Observational Evidence for Event Horizons

While event horizons cannot be directly observed, multiple lines of evidence strongly support their existence:

1. **X-ray Binary Observations**:
   - Compact objects in X-ray binaries exceed the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit for neutron stars (~3M_☉)
   - Lack of Type I X-ray bursts (thermonuclear explosions seen on neutron star surfaces)
   - Absence of pulsations that would indicate a solid surface
   - Spectral properties consistent with accretion disks extending to the innermost stable circular orbit
   - Example: Cygnus X-1, the first strong black hole candidate identified

2. **Supermassive Black Hole Evidence**:
   - Stellar orbits around Sgr A* at the center of the Milky Way indicate a compact object of ~4 million M_☉
   - Megamaser observations of water maser disks in galaxies like NGC 4258
   - Reverberation mapping of active galactic nuclei
   - M-σ relation between black hole mass and galaxy bulge velocity dispersion
   - Relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei requiring efficient energy extraction

3. **Event Horizon Telescope**:
   - First direct image of a black hole shadow in M87 (2019) and Sgr A* (2022)
   - Shadow size consistent with general relativistic predictions
   - Brightness asymmetry due to Doppler beaming from rotating accretion flow
   - Polarization measurements revealing magnetic field structure near the horizon
   - Consistent with predictions from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations

4. **Gravitational Wave Observations**:
   - LIGO/Virgo detections of binary black hole mergers
   - Waveforms match predictions from general relativity
   - Ringdown phase consistent with perturbed Kerr black hole
   - No evidence for echoes that would indicate exotic compact objects without horizons
   - Formation of a new horizon indicated by the sudden cessation of gravitational wave emission

5. **Distinguishing from Alternatives**:
   - Neutron stars: Black holes lack X-ray bursts, pulsations, and solid surface effects
   - Boson stars: Would produce gravitational wave echoes not seen in data
   - Gravastars: Would have different ringdown signatures
   - Naked singularities: Would violate cosmic censorship and produce distinctive signals
   - Wormholes: Would allow radiation to escape from the "other side"

The cumulative evidence from multiple independent observations across the electromagnetic spectrum and gravitational waves provides overwhelming support for the existence of event horizons. While no single observation can definitively prove the existence of an event horizon (as it is defined by the absence of signals), the consistency of all observations with general relativistic black hole models, and the lack of evidence for alternative explanations, makes the case for event horizons extremely strong.

## Mathematical Framework

### Spacetime Geometry Near Black Holes

The mathematics of curved spacetime provides the foundation for understanding black holes:

1. **Metric Tensor and Line Element**:
   - The spacetime interval in general coordinates:
     ds² = g_μν dx^μ dx^ν
   - Schwarzschild metric in standard coordinates:
     ds² = -(1-2GM/rc²)c²dt² + (1-2GM/rc²)⁻¹dr² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)
   - Coordinate singularity at r = 2GM/c² (removable with appropriate coordinate transformation)
   - Physical singularity at r = 0 (intrinsic, not coordinate-dependent)

2. **Geodesic Equations**:
   - World lines of freely falling particles satisfy:
     d²x^μ/dτ² + Γ^μ_νρ (dx^ν/dτ)(dx^ρ/dτ) = 0
   - Christoffel symbols for Schwarzschild metric:
     Γ^t_tr = Γ^t_rt = GM/r²c²(1-2GM/rc²)
     Γ^r_tt = GM/r²c²(1-2GM/rc²)²
     Γ^r_rr = -GM/r²c²(1-2GM/rc²)
     Γ^r_θθ = -(r-2GM/c²)
     Γ^r_φφ = -(r-2GM/c²)sin²θ
     Γ^θ_rθ = Γ^θ_θr = 1/r

     L = r²sin²θ(dφ/dτ)

4. **Effective Potential**:
   - Radial motion can be described by:
     (dr/dτ)² + V_eff(r) = E²/c⁴
   - Effective potential for massive particles:
     V_eff(r) = (1-2GM/rc²)(1+L²/r²c²)
   - For photons:
     V_eff(r) = (1-2GM/rc²)L²/r²

5. **Curvature Tensors**:
   - Riemann tensor components (non-zero):
     R^r_θrθ = R^r_φrφ/sin²θ = -R^θ_rθr = -R^φ_rφr/sin²θ = GM/c²r³
     R^θ_φθφ = -R^φ_θφθ = 2GM/c²r³sin²θ
   - Ricci tensor: R_μν = 0 (vacuum solution)
   - Kretschmann scalar: R_αβγδR^αβγδ = 48G²M²/c⁴r⁶

### Event Horizon Mathematics

The event horizon has specific mathematical properties that define its behavior:

1. **Horizon Location**:
   - Schwarzschild: r_h = 2GM/c²
   - Kerr: r_h = GM/c² + √((GM/c²)² - a²)
   - Reissner-Nordström: r_h = GM/c² + √((GM/c²)² - Q²G/4πε₀c⁴)
   - Kerr-Newman: r_h = GM/c² + √((GM/c²)² - a² - Q²G/4πε₀c⁴)

2. **Null Surface Properties**:
   - Normal vector to horizon: n_μ = ∂_μf where f = r - r_h
   - Null condition: g^μν n_μ n_ν = 0
   - Generators: Null geodesics that lie within the horizon
   - Expansion scalar: θ = ∇_μ ξ^μ (measures how generators converge or diverge)
   - Shear tensor: σ_μν (measures how generators are distorted)

3. **Surface Gravity**:
   - Definition: κ² = -½(∇_μ ξ_ν)(∇^μ ξ^ν) evaluated at horizon
   - For Schwarzschild: κ = c⁴/4GM
   - For Kerr: κ = c⁴√(1-a²)/4GM[1+√(1-a²)]
   - Related to temperature: T = ℏκ/2πk_B
   - Zeroth law: κ is constant over the horizon of a stationary black hole

4. **Area and Entropy**:
   - Area element: dA = √(g_θθ g_φφ) dθ dφ
   - Total area:
     A = ∫∫√(g_θθ g_φφ) dθ dφ
   - For Schwarzschild: A = 4πr_h² = 16πG²M²/c⁴
   - Entropy: S = k_B A/4ℓ_P²
   - First law: dM = (κ/8πG)dA + ΩdJ + ΦdQ

5. **Coordinate Systems**:
   - Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates:
     ds² = -(1-2GM/rc²)dv² + 2dvdr + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)
   - Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates:
     ds² = -(32G³M³/r)e^(-r/2GM)dUdV + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)
   - Painlevé-Gullstrand coordinates:
     ds² = -c²dt² + (dr + √(2GM/r)dt)² + r²(dθ² + sin²θ dφ²)

### Singularity Mathematics

The mathematical description of singularities reveals their nature and properties:

1. **Geodesic Incompleteness**:
   - A spacetime is geodesically incomplete if there exist geodesics that cannot be extended to arbitrary values of their affine parameter
   - For radial geodesics in Schwarzschild:
     τ_singularity = (πM/c³) for null geodesics
     τ_singularity ∝ (r₀³/²/GM)^(1/2) for timelike geodesics from r₀

2. **Curvature Invariants**:
   - Ricci scalar: R = 0 (vacuum solution)
   - Kretschmann scalar: K = R_αβγδR^αβγδ = 48G²M²/c⁴r⁶
   - Weyl scalar: C_αβγδC^αβγδ = 48G²M²/c⁴r⁶
   - All diverge as r → 0, indicating a genuine physical singularity

3. **BKL Conjecture**:
   - Near spacelike singularities, time derivatives dominate over spatial derivatives
   - Dynamics becomes effectively point-like but chaotic
   - Described by a sequence of Kasner epochs with transitions modeled by Bianchi IX dynamics
   - Mixmaster behavior: Oscillatory approach to singularity

4. **Singularity Theorems**:
   - Penrose (1965): If (M,g_μν) contains a trapped surface, then it contains a singularity
   - Hawking (1967): Under certain energy conditions, all cosmological solutions with positive spatial curvature contain singularities
   - Hawking-Penrose (1970): If (M,g_μν) satisfies:
     1. R_μν v^μ v^ν ≥ 0 for all timelike v^μ (strong energy condition)
     2. No closed timelike curves
     3. Contains a trapped surface or compact achronal set
     Then it contains incomplete geodesics

5. **Quantum Corrections**:
   - Expected to become important when curvature approaches Planck scale: R ~ 1/ℓ_P²
   - Modified Einstein equations: G_μν = 8πG/c⁴ T_μν + α R_μν R + β R² + ...
   - Potential resolution through:
     - Bounce models (loop quantum gravity)
     - Fuzzballs (string theory)
     - Noncommutative geometry effects

## Practical Applications and Exercises

### Problem 1: Schwarzschild Radius Calculation

Calculate the Schwarzschild radius for various astronomical objects:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   Determine the Schwarzschild radius for:
   a) The Sun (M = 1.99 × 10³⁰ kg)
   b) Earth (M = 5.97 × 10²⁴ kg)
   c) A typical stellar-mass black hole (M = 10 M_☉)
   d) The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way (M = 4.3 × 10⁶ M_☉)
   e) The supermassive black hole in M87 (M = 6.5 × 10⁹ M_☉)

2. **Solution**:
   Using r_s = 2GM/c²:
   a) r_s(Sun) = 2(6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg·s²)(1.99 × 10³⁰ kg)/(3 × 10⁸ m/s)² = 2.95 km
   b) r_s(Earth) = 2(6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg·s²)(5.97 × 10²⁴ kg)/(3 × 10⁸ m/s)² = 8.87 mm
   c) r_s(10 M_☉) = 10 × 2.95 km = 29.5 km
   d) r_s(4.3 × 10⁶ M_☉) = 4.3 × 10⁶ × 2.95 km = 12.7 million km ≈ 0.085 AU
   e) r_s(6.5 × 10⁹ M_☉) = 6.5 × 10⁹ × 2.95 km = 19.2 billion km ≈ 128 AU

3. **Discussion**:
   - The Sun's Schwarzschild radius is much smaller than its actual radius (~696,000 km), so it's not a black hole
   - Earth's Schwarzschild radius is tiny compared to its size
   - The Milky Way's central black hole has a Schwarzschild radius smaller than Mercury's orbit
   - M87's black hole has a Schwarzschild radius larger than our entire solar system

### Problem 2: Gravitational Time Dilation Near a Black Hole

Calculate the time dilation factor at various distances from a black hole:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   For a Schwarzschild black hole of 10 solar masses, calculate the time dilation factor (dt_distant/dt_local) at:
   a) r = 100r_s
   b) r = 10r_s
   c) r = 3r_s
   d) r = 2.1r_s
   e) r = 2.01r_s

2. **Solution**:
   The time dilation factor is given by:
   dt_distant/dt_local = 1/√(1-2GM/rc²) = 1/√(1-r_s/r)
   
   a) At r = 100r_s: dt_distant/dt_local = 1/√(1-1/100) = 1/√0.99 = 1.005
   b) At r = 10r_s: dt_distant/dt_local = 1/√(1-1/10) = 1/√0.9 = 1.054
   c) At r = 3r_s: dt_distant/dt_local = 1/√(1-1/3) = 1/√0.667 = 1.225
   d) At r = 2.1r_s: dt_distant/dt_local = 1/√(1-1/2.1) = 1/√0.524 = 1.382
   e) At r = 2.01r_s: dt_distant/dt_local = 1/√(1-1/2.01) = 1/√0.502 = 1.410

3. **Discussion**:
   - Time dilation becomes more extreme as one approaches the event horizon
   - At r = 2r_s (the event horizon), the time dilation factor becomes infinite
   - For an observer at r = 2.01r_s, 1 second of their time corresponds to 1.41 seconds for a distant observer
   - This explains why, to a distant observer, objects appear to slow down and freeze as they approach the horizon

### Problem 3: Photon Orbits Around a Black Hole

Analyze the orbits of photons around a Schwarzschild black hole:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   For a Schwarzschild black hole:
   a) Derive the effective potential for photon orbits
   b) Find the radius of the photon sphere
   c) Calculate the impact parameter for a photon to orbit at the photon sphere
   d) Determine what happens to photons with slightly smaller or larger impact parameters

2. **Solution**:
   a) The effective potential for photons is:
      V_eff(r) = L²(1-2GM/rc²)/r²
      where L is the angular momentum per unit mass
   
   b) The photon sphere is located where V_eff'(r) = 0:
      V_eff'(r) = L²[(-2)(1-2GM/rc²)/r³ + (2GM/c²r²)/r²]
      Setting this equal to zero:
      (-2)(1-2GM/rc²) + 2GM/c²r = 0
      -2 + 4GM/rc² + 2GM/c²r = 0
      4GM/rc² + 2GM/c²r = 2
      2GM/rc²(2/r + 1) = 2
      2GM/c²(2/r + 1) = 2r
      2GM/c²(2 + r) = 2r²
      GM/c²(2 + r) = r²
      For r >> GM/c², this gives r ≈ 3GM/c² = 1.5r_s
   
   c) The impact parameter b = L/E for a photon at the photon sphere is:
      b = r/√(1-2GM/rc²) = 3GM/c²/√(1-2/3) = 3GM/c²/√(1/3) = 3GM/c² × √3 = 3√3 GM/c²
   
   d) Photons with impact parameter b < 3√3 GM/c² will fall into the black hole
      Photons with impact parameter b > 3√3 GM/c² will be deflected and escape to infinity

3. **Discussion**:
   - The photon sphere at r = 3GM/c² represents unstable circular orbits for light
   - This creates the "shadow" of a black hole seen in Event Horizon Telescope images
   - The critical impact parameter 3√3 GM/c² determines whether light is captured
   - This is crucial for understanding gravitational lensing by black holes

### Problem 4: Tidal Forces Near a Black Hole

Calculate the tidal forces experienced by an object falling into a black hole:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   An astronaut of height 2 meters falls radially toward a 10 solar mass black hole, feet first. Calculate the difference in gravitational acceleration between the astronaut's head and feet when the astronaut's feet are at:
   a) r = 1000 km
   b) r = 100 km
   c) r = 30 km (approximately the event horizon)

2. **Solution**:
   The tidal acceleration across a distance Δr is given by:
   Δa = (2GM/r³)Δr
   
   For a 10 solar mass black hole, M = 10 × 1.99 × 10³⁰ kg = 1.99 × 10³¹ kg
   
   a) At r = 1000 km = 10⁶ m:
      Δa = (2 × 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ × 1.99 × 10³¹)/(10⁶)³ × 2 m
      = (2.65 × 10²²)/(10¹⁸) m/s²
      = 2.65 × 10⁴ m/s² ≈ 2,700g
   
   b) At r = 100 km = 10⁵ m:
      Δa = (2.65 × 10²²)/(10¹⁵) m/s²
      = 2.65 × 10⁷ m/s² ≈ 2.7 million g
   
   c) At r = 30 km = 3 × 10⁴ m:
      Δa = (2.65 × 10²²)/(2.7 × 10¹³) m/s²
      = 9.8 × 10⁸ m/s² ≈ 100 million g

3. **Discussion**:
   - Tidal forces increase dramatically as one approaches the black hole (∝ 1/r³)
   - At 1000 km, the tidal forces are already thousands of times Earth's gravity
   - At the event horizon, tidal forces would be lethal for a stellar-mass black hole
   - For supermassive black holes, tidal forces at the horizon are much weaker due to the larger radius
   - This is known as "spaghettification" or the "noodle effect"

### Problem 5: Hawking Radiation and Black Hole Evaporation

Analyze the properties of Hawking radiation for different black holes:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   Calculate for the following black holes:
   a) The Hawking temperature for a 10 solar mass black hole
   b) The Hawking temperature for a supermassive black hole of 4.3 million solar masses
   c) The Hawking temperature for a primordial black hole of mass 10¹⁵ kg
   d) The lifetime of the primordial black hole

2. **Solution**:
   a) The Hawking temperature is given by:
      T = ℏc³/8πGMk_B
      For a 10 M_☉ black hole:
      T = (1.05 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)(3 × 10⁸ m/s)³/(8π × 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg·s² × 1.99 × 10³¹ kg × 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K)
      = 6.2 × 10⁻⁹ K
   
   b) For a 4.3 × 10⁶ M_☉ black hole:
      T = 6.2 × 10⁻⁹ K × (10/4.3 × 10⁶) = 1.4 × 10⁻¹⁵ K
   
   c) For a 10¹⁵ kg black hole:
      T = (1.05 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)(3 × 10⁸ m/s)³/(8π × 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg·s² × 10¹⁵ kg × 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K)
      = 1.2 × 10¹¹ K
   
   d) The lifetime of an evaporating black hole is approximately:
      τ ≈ 5120πG²M³/ℏc⁴
      For a 10¹⁵ kg black hole:
      τ ≈ 5120π(6.67 × 10⁻¹¹)²(10¹⁵)³/(1.05 × 10⁻³⁴)(3 × 10⁸)⁴
      ≈ 2.1 × 10¹¹ seconds ≈ 6,700 years

3. **Discussion**:
   - Stellar and supermassive black holes have extremely low temperatures, making Hawking radiation negligible
   - Primordial black holes with mass around 10¹⁵ kg would be extremely hot and could be evaporating now
   - As a black hole evaporates, it gets hotter and evaporates faster
   - The final stages of evaporation would release tremendous energy in a very short time
   - This process connects quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and general relativity
