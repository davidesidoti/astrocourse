# Simplified Mathematical Models of Black Holes

## Introduction to Simplified Models

Understanding black holes in their full mathematical complexity requires advanced knowledge of general relativity and differential geometry. However, many key features and behaviors of black holes can be understood through simplified mathematical models that capture the essential physics while remaining accessible to those without specialized training in relativistic physics.

These simplified models serve several important purposes. They provide intuitive insights into black hole phenomena, serve as pedagogical stepping stones toward more complete treatments, and offer practical approximations for certain astrophysical calculations. While these models cannot capture all aspects of black hole physics—particularly those that are intrinsically relativistic—they nonetheless provide valuable physical understanding and reasonably accurate predictions in appropriate regimes.

In this section, we will explore several simplified approaches to black hole physics. We begin with Newtonian gravity and the concept of escape velocity, which provides a surprisingly useful analogy for understanding event horizons. We then examine gravitational redshift in both Newtonian and relativistic contexts. The effective potential approach offers powerful insights into orbital dynamics around black holes, while simplified models of accretion illuminate how black holes interact with their surroundings. Throughout, we will emphasize the strengths and limitations of each approach, highlighting where simplified models provide adequate approximations and where fully relativistic treatments become necessary.

By mastering these simplified models, you will develop physical intuition for black hole phenomena and gain practical tools for solving problems in black hole astrophysics, all while preparing for the more mathematically sophisticated treatments in subsequent sections.

## Newtonian Approximation of Gravity

While black holes are fundamentally relativistic objects, Newtonian gravity provides a surprisingly useful framework for understanding certain aspects of black hole physics:

1. **Basic Principles of Newtonian Gravity**:
   - Gravitational force between two masses m₁ and m₂:
     F = G(m₁m₂)/r²
   - Gravitational potential:
     Φ = -GM/r
   - Gravitational acceleration:
     g = GM/r²
   - Gravitational potential energy:
     U = -GMm/r

2. **Newtonian Prediction of Black Holes**:
   - John Michell (1783) and Pierre-Simon Laplace (1796) independently proposed "dark stars"
   - Using Newtonian mechanics and corpuscular theory of light
   - If light has finite speed c and is affected by gravity, it could be trapped
   - This occurs when escape velocity exceeds c
   - Remarkably, this gives the correct Schwarzschild radius: r_s = 2GM/c²

3. **Validity and Limitations**:
   - Valid for weak gravitational fields: GM/rc² ≪ 1
   - Valid for low velocities: v ≪ c
   - Cannot account for:
     - Gravitational time dilation
     - Space curvature
     - Gravitational waves
     - Frame dragging
     - Horizon formation dynamics

4. **Post-Newtonian Approximation**:
   - Systematic expansion in powers of v/c and GM/rc²
   - First post-Newtonian (1PN) order includes:
     - Time dilation effects
     - Relativistic corrections to orbital motion
   - Higher orders (2PN, 3PN, etc.) include additional effects
   - Used extensively in gravitational wave calculations

The Newtonian approximation provides a useful conceptual bridge between familiar physics and the more exotic relativistic phenomena of black holes. While it cannot capture the full richness of black hole physics, it offers valuable intuition and reasonably accurate predictions for weak-field scenarios.

## Escape Velocity Concept

The escape velocity concept provides one of the most intuitive ways to understand the basic nature of black holes:

1. **Definition and Basic Formula**:
   - Escape velocity: Minimum initial velocity needed for an object to escape to infinity
   - In Newtonian mechanics:
     v_esc = √(2GM/r)
   - Derived by equating kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy:
     (1/2)mv² = GMm/r
   - Independent of the mass of the escaping object
   - Decreases with distance: v_esc ∝ 1/√r

2. **Critical Radius for Light Trapping**:
   - If v_esc = c, light cannot escape
   - Setting v_esc = c and solving for r:
     r_critical = 2GM/c²
   - This exactly matches the Schwarzschild radius from general relativity
   - For Earth: r_critical ≈ 9 mm
   - For Sun: r_critical ≈ 3 km
   - For a 10 solar mass black hole: r_critical ≈ 30 km

3. **Conceptual Insights and Limitations**:
   - Provides intuitive understanding of "point of no return"
   - Correctly predicts size of event horizon
   - However, the physical mechanism is fundamentally different:
     - Newtonian: Light slows down and stops
     - Relativistic: Light maintains speed c but spacetime curvature prevents outward paths
   - Cannot explain:
     - Photon spheres
     - Time dilation effects
     - Causal structure of spacetime

4. **Pedagogical Value**:
   - Accessible entry point using familiar physics
   - Demonstrates historical development of black hole concept
   - Shows how different physical theories can predict similar phenomena
   - Helps distinguish between coincidental agreement and fundamental explanation

The escape velocity concept demonstrates how even simplified models can capture important aspects of black hole physics. While the Newtonian explanation differs fundamentally from the relativistic one, the numerical agreement is not coincidental—it reflects the correspondence principle, whereby general relativity must reduce to Newtonian gravity in the appropriate limit.

## Gravitational Redshift

Gravitational redshift—the shifting of light to longer wavelengths as it climbs out of a gravitational potential—provides a crucial link between Newtonian and relativistic descriptions of gravity:

1. **Newtonian Derivation**:
   - Consider a photon with energy E = hν climbing out of a gravitational potential
   - Conservation of energy: hν₁ + mΦ₁ = hν₂ + mΦ₂
   - Using E = mc² for the effective mass of a photon: m = hν/c²
   - Substituting and simplifying:
     ν₂/ν₁ = (1 + Φ₁/c²)/(1 + Φ₂/c²)
   - For Φ = -GM/r and Φ₂ = 0 (infinity):
     ν₂/ν₁ = 1 - GM/rc²
   - Wavelength ratio: λ₂/λ₁ = 1/(1 - GM/rc²)

2. **Relativistic Derivation**:
   - In general relativity, time runs slower in stronger gravitational fields
   - For Schwarzschild metric, time dilation factor: dt_distant/dt_local = 1/√(1 - 2GM/rc²)
   - Frequency scales inversely with time: ν ∝ 1/dt
   - Therefore: ν₂/ν₁ = √(1 - 2GM/r₁c²)
   - Wavelength ratio: λ₂/λ₁ = 1/√(1 - 2GM/r₁c²)

3. **Comparison and Convergence**:
   - For weak fields (GM/rc² ≪ 1), Taylor expansion gives:
     - Newtonian: λ₂/λ₁ ≈ 1 + GM/rc²
     - Relativistic: λ₂/λ₁ ≈ 1 + GM/rc²
   - Agreement to first order in GM/rc²
   - Divergence at stronger fields
   - At r = 2GM/c² (event horizon):
     - Newtonian: λ₂/λ₁ = 2
     - Relativistic: λ₂/λ₁ = ∞

4. **Observational Consequences**:
   - Solar gravitational redshift: z ≈ 2.12 × 10⁻⁶
   - White dwarf Sirius B: z ≈ 3 × 10⁻⁴
   - Neutron star: z ≈ 0.2-0.3
   - Near black hole horizon: z → ∞
   - Pound-Rebka experiment (1959): First laboratory confirmation
   - GPS satellites: Must account for gravitational redshift for accurate timing

Gravitational redshift illustrates how Newtonian physics can be extended to provide approximate relativistic results. The agreement between the two approaches for weak fields is not accidental but reflects the correspondence principle. The divergence at strong fields highlights where simplified models break down and full general relativity becomes essential.

## Effective Potential Approach

The effective potential approach provides a powerful method for analyzing orbital dynamics around black holes using familiar concepts from classical mechanics:

1. **Derivation from Conservation Laws**:
   - For a particle in a central force field, energy and angular momentum are conserved
   - Energy per unit mass: E = (1/2)v² + Φ(r)
   - Angular momentum per unit mass: L = rv_θ
   - Radial velocity: v_r = dr/dt
   - Tangential velocity: v_θ = rdθ/dt
   - Total velocity: v² = v_r² + v_θ²
   - Substituting v_θ = L/r:
     E = (1/2)v_r² + (1/2)(L/r)² + Φ(r)
   - Rearranging:
     (1/2)v_r² = E - [(1/2)(L/r)² + Φ(r)]
   - The term in brackets is the effective potential:
     V_eff(r) = (1/2)(L/r)² + Φ(r)

2. **Newtonian Effective Potential**:
   - For Newtonian gravity: Φ(r) = -GM/r
   - Effective potential:
     V_eff(r) = (1/2)(L/r)² - GM/r
   - Extrema found by setting dV_eff/dr = 0:
     dV_eff/dr = -L²/r³ + GM/r² = 0
   - Solving: r_circular = L²/GM
   - Circular orbit energy: E_circular = -GM/2r_circular
   - Stable circular orbits exist for all r > 0

3. **Pseudo-Newtonian Potentials**:
   - Approximate relativistic effects while maintaining Newtonian framework
   - Paczyński-Wiita potential:
     Φ_PW(r) = -GM/(r - r_s)
   - Effective potential:
     V_eff(r) = (1/2)(L/r)² - GM/(r - r_s)
   - Correctly reproduces:
     - Innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) at r = 6GM/c²
     - Marginally bound orbit at r = 4GM/c²
     - Photon sphere at r = 3GM/c²
   - Widely used in accretion disk simulations

4. **Relativistic Effective Potential**:
   - Derived from geodesic equations in Schwarzschild metric
   - For massive particles:
     V_eff(r) = (1 - 2GM/rc²)[(L/r)² + 1]
   - For photons:
     V_eff(r) = (1 - 2GM/rc²)(L/r)²
   - Key features:
     - ISCO at r = 6GM/c²
     - Photon sphere at r = 3GM/c²
     - No stable circular orbits for r < 6GM/c²

The effective potential approach bridges Newtonian and relativistic physics, providing intuitive understanding of orbital dynamics around black holes. While simplified models like the Paczyński-Wiita potential cannot capture all relativistic effects, they offer valuable approximations for many astrophysical calculations and serve as stepping stones toward fully relativistic treatments.

## Particle Orbits Around Black Holes

The motion of particles around black holes reveals fundamental aspects of black hole physics and has important astrophysical implications:

1. **Types of Orbits in Schwarzschild Spacetime**:
   - Bound orbits: E < 1, particle remains at finite distance
   - Unbound orbits: E > 1, particle can escape to infinity
   - Marginally bound orbits: E = 1, particle has zero velocity at infinity
   - Circular orbits: V_eff'(r) = 0, particle maintains constant radius
   - Stable circular orbits: V_eff''(r) > 0, resist small perturbations
   - Unstable circular orbits: V_eff''(r) < 0, perturbations grow

2. **Critical Orbits and Radii**:
   - Innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO):
     - Located at r = 6GM/c²
     - Last stable orbit before plunging into black hole
     - Inner edge of thin accretion disks
     - Energy: E_ISCO = 2√2/3 ≈ 0.943
   - Marginally bound orbit:
     - Located at r = 4GM/c²
     - Particles with E = 1 can orbit here
     - Particles with r < 4GM/c² and E = 1 fall into black hole
   - Photon sphere:
     - Located at r = 3GM/c²
     - Unstable circular orbits for light
     - Creates black hole "shadow" in images

3. **Simplified Calculations**:
   - Orbital period for circular orbit at radius r:
     - Newtonian: T = 2π√(r³/GM)
     - Relativistic: T = 2πr³/²/√(GM) · [1 - 3GM/rc²]^(-1)
   - Precession of elliptical orbits:
     - Newtonian: No precession
     - Relativistic: Δφ = 6πGM/ac²(1-e²) per orbit
     - Mercury's precession: 43 arcseconds per century
   - Orbital energy at radius r:
     - Newtonian: E = -GM/2r
     - Relativistic: E = (1-2GM/rc²)/√(1-3GM/rc²)

4. **Astrophysical Applications**:
   - Accretion disk dynamics:
     - Inner edge at ISCO
     - Efficiency: η = 1 - E_ISCO ≈ 5.7%
   - Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs):
     - Small object orbiting supermassive black hole
     - Gravitational wave source for LISA
   - X-ray spectroscopy:
     - Iron line profiles shaped by orbital dynamics
     - Measures black hole spin
   - Tidal disruption events:
     - Stars torn apart by tidal forces
     - Disruption radius vs. ISCO determines event properties

Understanding particle orbits around black holes is essential for interpreting observations and modeling astrophysical phenomena. While fully relativistic calculations are necessary for precise results, simplified models provide valuable insights and reasonably accurate approximations for many applications.

## Photon Spheres and Unstable Orbits

Photon spheres—regions where light can orbit a black hole—represent a uniquely relativistic phenomenon with important observational consequences:

1. **Photon Sphere Basics**:
   - Surface where photons can orbit in unstable circular paths
   - For Schwarzschild black hole: r_photon = 3GM/c²
   - For Kerr black hole: varies with latitude, r_photon = 1-3GM/c² at equator for maximally spinning case
   - Unstable equilibrium: small perturbations cause photons to either fall in or escape
   - No stable photon orbits around non-rotating black holes

2. **Mathematical Description**:
   - Effective potential for photons:
     V_eff(r) = (1 - 2GM/rc²)(L/r)²
   - Maximum occurs at r = 3GM/c²
   - Impact parameter for photon sphere:
     b_critical = 3√3 GM/c²
   - Photons with b < b_critical fall into black hole
   - Photons with b > b_critical are deflected
   - Photons with b = b_critical approach photon sphere asymptotically

3. **Simplified Models**:
   - Paczyński-Wiita potential correctly predicts photon sphere at r = 3GM/c²
   - Gravitational lensing approximation:
     - Deflection angle: α = 4GM/bc²
     - Diverges as b approaches b_critical
     - For Sun: α ≈ 1.75 arcseconds
     - For typical black hole: can be many degrees

4. **Observational Implications**:
   - Black hole shadow:
     - Dark region in black hole images
     - Radius approximately 5GM/c² (larger than photon sphere)
     - Observed in M87* and Sgr A* by Event Horizon Telescope
   - Einstein rings:
     - Light from source directly behind black hole forms ring
     - Multiple rings possible due to photons orbiting different numbers of times
   - Gravitational lensing:
     - Strong deflection near photon sphere creates multiple images
     - Time delays between images
   - Quasi-normal modes:
     - Ringdown frequencies related to photon sphere properties
     - Detected in LIGO/Virgo black hole merger observations

The photon sphere represents a critical boundary in black hole spacetime, separating photons that escape to infinity from those that fall into the black hole. While fully relativistic calculations are necessary for precise results, simplified models can capture the essential physics and provide valuable insights into this fascinating phenomenon.

## Simplified Models of Accretion

Accretion—the process by which black holes gather matter—can be understood through simplified models that capture the essential physics while remaining mathematically tractable:

1. **Bondi Accretion (Spherical Accretion)**:
   - Assumes spherically symmetric, steady flow of gas onto black hole
   - Neglects angular momentum and magnetic fields
   - Key parameters:
     - Sound speed at infinity: c_∞

       ∂Σ/∂t = (3/r)∂/∂r[r^(1/2)∂/∂r(νΣr^(1/2))]
     - Temperature profile for steady state:
       T(r) = [3GMṀ/8πσr³(1-√(r_in/r))]^(1/4)
     - Inner edge at r_in = 6GM/c²
   - Efficiency:
     η = 1 - √(1-2GM/r_inc²) ≈ 0.057 for non-rotating black hole
   - Luminosity:
     L = ηṀc²

3. **Advection-Dominated Accretion Flow (ADAF)**:
   - Simplified model for low-density, hot accretion
   - Most energy remains in gas rather than being radiated
   - Key features:
     - Nearly virial temperature: T ∝ GMm_p/kr
     - Thick disk: H ∼ r
     - Self-similar solution:
       ρ(r) ∝ r^(-3/2)
       v_r(r) ∝ r^(-1/2)
       v_φ(r) ∝ r^(-1/2)
   - Low radiative efficiency: η ≪ 0.1
   - Applicable to low-luminosity active galactic nuclei

4. **Simplified Jet Models**:
   - Blandford-Znajek process:
     - Extracts rotational energy from black hole
     - Power: P_BZ ∝ B²(J/M)²
     - Requires magnetic field threading horizon
   - Simplified jet velocity:
     v_jet ≈ c√(r_g/r_launch)
     where r_g = GM/c² and r_launch is the launching radius
   - Collimation via magnetic hoop stress or external pressure
   - Simplified energy conversion:
     - Kinetic energy: ~40%
     - Magnetic energy: ~40%
     - Thermal energy: ~20%

These simplified accretion models provide valuable insights into how black holes interact with their surroundings. While they cannot capture all the complex physics involved in real accretion flows, they offer reasonable approximations for many astrophysical scenarios and serve as building blocks for more sophisticated models.

## Pedagogical Approaches to Black Hole Physics

Teaching and learning black hole physics presents unique challenges due to the abstract mathematical formalism and counterintuitive physical concepts. Several pedagogical approaches can make these topics more accessible:

1. **Dimensional Analysis and Scale Arguments**:

By starting with simplified models and gradually introducing more complex concepts, students can develop physical intuition for black hole phenomena while building the mathematical skills necessary for a deeper understanding.

## Mathematical Framework

### Newtonian Gravity and Its Limitations

The mathematical framework of Newtonian gravity provides a foundation for understanding black holes, while its limitations highlight the need for general relativity:

1. **Basic Equations of Newtonian Gravity**:
   - Gravitational force law:
     F = G(m₁m₂)/r² r̂
   - Gravitational field:
     g = -∇Φ = -GM/r² r̂
   - Gravitational potential:
     Φ = -GM/r
   - Poisson's equation:
     ∇²Φ = 4πGρ
   - Equations of motion:
     d²r/dt² = -∇Φ

2. **Newtonian Black Hole Calculation**:
   - Escape velocity:
     v_esc = √(2GM/r)
   - Setting v_esc = c:
     c = √(2GM/r_s)
   - Solving for r_s:
     r_s = 2GM/c²
   - Coincidentally matches the Schwarzschild radius

3. **Post-Newtonian Approximation**:
   - Systematic expansion in powers of v/c and GM/rc²
   - Modified potential:
     Φ_PN = -GM/r[1 + (v/c)² + 3(p/ρc²) + ...]
   - Modified equations of motion:
     d²r/dt² = -∇Φ - (4GM/rc²)v×(v×r̂)/r + ...
   - Includes:
     - Relativistic corrections to orbital motion
     - Gravitational time dilation
     - Gravitomagnetic effects

4. **Fundamental Limitations**:
   - Assumes absolute time and space
   - Assumes instantaneous propagation of gravity
   - Cannot describe:
     - Spacetime curvature
     - Event horizons as geometric features
     - Gravitational waves
     - Frame dragging
     - Strong-field phenomena

The Newtonian framework provides valuable insights and approximations for weak gravitational fields but breaks down near black holes where relativistic effects become dominant. The post-Newtonian approach extends the range of validity but ultimately a fully relativistic treatment is necessary.

### Effective Potential Formalism

The effective potential formalism provides a powerful mathematical framework for analyzing orbital dynamics around black holes:

1. **Newtonian Effective Potential**:
   - For a particle with specific angular momentum L:
     V_eff(r) = L²/2r² - GM/r
   - Radial equation of motion:
     (dr/dt)² = 2[E - V_eff(r)]
   - Circular orbits at extrema of V_eff:
     dV_eff/dr = -L²/r³ + GM/r² = 0
   - Solving for circular orbit radius:
     r_circ = L²/GM
   - Stability condition:
     d²V_eff/dr² = 3L²/r⁴ - 2GM/r³ > 0
   - Always satisfied for r > 0 in Newtonian case

2. **Relativistic Effective Potential (Schwarzschild)**:
   - For massive particles:
     V_eff(r) = (1 - 2GM/rc²)[(L/r)² + 1]
   - Radial equation of motion:
     (dr/dτ)² = E² - V_eff(r)
   - Circular orbits:
     dV_eff/dr = 0
     r_circ = L²/GM · [1 ± √(1 - 12(GM/Lc)²)]⁻¹
   - Stability condition:
     d²V_eff/dr² > 0
   - Stable circular orbits only for r > 6GM/c²

3. **Pseudo-Newtonian Potentials**:
   - Paczyński-Wiita potential:
     Φ_PW(r) = -GM/(r - r_s)
   - Effective potential:
     V_eff(r) = L²/2r² - GM/(r - r_s)
   - Circular orbits:
     r_circ = (L²/2GM)[1 + √(1 - 12(GM/Lc)²)]
   - Innermost stable circular orbit at r = 6GM/c²
   - Captures key relativistic features with Newtonian formalism

4. **Mathematical Analysis Techniques**:
   - Energy curves: E(L) for circular orbits
   - Binding energy: E_bind = 1 - E
   - Orbital stability: d²V_eff/dr² > 0
   - Radial oscillations: ω_r² = (1/2)d²V_eff/dr²
   - Precession rate:
     Δφ/2π = 1/√(1 - 6GM/rc²) - 1

The effective potential formalism provides a mathematically elegant approach to orbital dynamics around black holes. By recasting the equations of motion in terms of an effective potential, complex orbital behaviors can be understood through familiar concepts from classical mechanics.

### Gravitational Redshift Calculations

The mathematical treatment of gravitational redshift connects Newtonian concepts to relativistic effects:

1. **Newtonian Derivation**:
   - Energy of photon with frequency ν: E = hν
   - Effective mass of photon: m = hν/c²
   - Conservation of energy between points 1 and 2:
     hν₁ - GMm₁/r₁ = hν₂ - GMm₂/r₂
   - Substituting m = hν/c²:
     hν₁(1 - GM/r₁c²) = hν₂(1 - GM/r₂c²)
   - For r₂ → ∞:
     ν₂/ν₁ = 1 - GM/r₁c²
   - Redshift parameter:
     z = (λ₂ - λ₁)/λ₁ = ν₁/ν₂ - 1 = GM/r₁c² + O((GM/r₁c²)²)

2. **Relativistic Derivation**:
   - In Schwarzschild spacetime:
     ds² = -(1-2GM/rc²)c²dt² + (1-2GM/rc²)⁻¹dr² + r²dΩ²
   - For static observers, proper time: dτ = √(1-2GM/rc²)dt
   - Frequency ratio:
     ν₂/ν₁ = dτ₁/dτ₂ = √(1-2GM/r₁c²)/√(1-2GM/r₂c²)
   - For r₂ → ∞:
     ν₂/ν₁ = √(1-2GM/r₁c²)
   - Redshift parameter:
     z = 1/√(1-2GM/r₁c²) - 1
   - Taylor expansion for weak fields:
     z ≈ GM/r₁c² + 3(GM/r₁c²)²/2 + ...

3. **Comparison and Convergence**:
   - First-order agreement: both give z ≈ GM/rc²
   - Relativistic result includes higher-order terms
   - Near event horizon (r → 2GM/c²):
     - Newtonian: z → 0.5
     - Relativistic: z → ∞

4. **Mathematical Applications**:
   - Surface gravity calculation:
     κ = GM/r²√(1-2GM/rc²)
   - Tolman-Ehrenfest effect:
     T√g₀₀ = constant
   - Gravitational time delay:
     Δt = 2GM/c³ ln(4r₁r₂/b²c²)
   - Shapiro delay:
     Δt_Shapiro = 4GM/c³ ln(4r₁r₂/b²)

The mathematical treatment of gravitational redshift illustrates how Newtonian physics can be extended to approximate relativistic effects. The agreement between approaches for weak fields demonstrates the correspondence principle, while the divergence at strong fields highlights where simplified models break down.

### Simplified Black Hole Thermodynamics

Black hole thermodynamics can be approached through simplified mathematical models that capture the essential physics:

1. **Hawking Temperature Derivation**:
   - Dimensional analysis approach:
     - Temperature must involve ℏ, c, G, and M
     - Only combination with units of temperature: ℏc³/GMk_B
     - Correct formula includes numerical factor:
       T_H = ℏc³/8πGMk_B
   - Semi-classical approximation:
     - Surface gravity: κ = c⁴/4GM
     - Hawking temperature: T_H = ℏκ/2πk_Bc
     - For 10 M_☉ black hole: T_H ≈ 6 × 10⁻⁹ K

2. **Entropy Calculations**:
   - Bekenstein-Hawking entropy:
     S_BH = k_BA/4ℓ_P²
     where A = 4πr_s² = 16πG²M²/c⁴ and ℓ_P = √(ℏG/c³)
   - Simplified form:
     S_BH = 4πk_BGM²/ℏc
   - For 10 M_☉ black hole: S_BH ≈ 10⁷⁷ k_B
   - Comparison to ordinary matter:
     S_matter ≈ 10⁵⁷ k_B for 10 M_☉ star

3. **Black Hole Evaporation**:
   - Stefan-Boltzmann law approximation:
     dM/dt = -σAT⁴/c²
   - Substituting A and T:
     dM/dt = -ℏc⁴/15360πG²M²
   - Lifetime:
     τ ≈ 5120πG²M³/ℏc⁴
   - For 10 M_☉ black hole: τ ≈ 10⁶⁷ years
   - For 10¹⁵ g primordial black hole: τ ≈ 10¹¹ seconds ≈ 3000 years

4. **First Law of Black Hole Mechanics**:
   - Simplified form for Schwarzschild black hole:
     dM = TdS
   - Full form including rotation and charge:
     dM = (κ/8πG)dA + ΩdJ + ΦdQ
   - Work terms:
     - Rotational: ΩdJ
     - Electromagnetic: ΦdQ
   - Efficiency of energy extraction:
     η_max = 1 - √(1/2) ≈ 29% for extremal Kerr black hole

These simplified approaches to black hole thermodynamics provide valuable insights without requiring the full machinery of quantum field theory in curved spacetime. While they cannot capture all the subtleties of the complete theory, they offer reasonable approximations and build intuition for these complex phenomena.

## Practical Applications and Exercises

### Problem 1: Calculating Black Hole Properties

Use simplified models to calculate basic properties of black holes:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   For a black hole with mass M = 15 solar masses:
   a) Calculate the Schwarzschild radius
   b) Calculate the area of the event horizon
   c) Calculate the surface gravity
   d) Calculate the Hawking temperature
   e) Calculate the entropy

2. **Solution**:
   a) Schwarzschild radius:
      r_s = 2GM/c²
      = 2(6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg·s²)(15 × 1.99 × 10³⁰ kg)/(3 × 10⁸ m/s)²
      = 44.3 km

   b) Event horizon area:
      A = 4πr_s²
      = 4π(44.3 × 10³ m)²
      = 2.46 × 10¹⁰ m²

   c) Surface gravity:
      κ = c⁴/4GM
      = (3 × 10⁸ m/s)⁴/[4(6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg·s²)(15 × 1.99 × 10³⁰ kg)]
      = 6.75 × 10¹⁰ m/s²

   d) Hawking temperature:
      T_H = ℏκ/2πk_Bc
      = (1.05 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)(6.75 × 10¹⁰ m/s²)/[2π(1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K)(3 × 10⁸ m/s)]
      = 4.1 × 10⁻⁹ K

   e) Entropy:
      S_BH = k_BA/4ℓ_P²
      = k_BA/4(ℏG/c³)
      = k_BAc³/4ℏG
      = (1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K)(2.46 × 10¹⁰ m²)(3 × 10⁸ m/s)³/[4(1.05 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s)(6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg·s²)]
      = 1.54 × 10⁷⁹ J/K

3. **Discussion**:
   - The Schwarzschild radius scales linearly with mass
   - The Hawking temperature is inversely proportional to mass
   - The entropy is proportional to the square of the mass
   - For stellar-mass black holes, the Hawking temperature is extremely low
   - The entropy is enormously larger than that of the original star (typically ~10⁵⁷ J/K)

### Problem 2: Gravitational Redshift

Calculate and compare gravitational redshift using Newtonian and relativistic approaches:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   A light source emits radiation with wavelength λ = 500 nm at a distance r from a black hole with mass M = 10 solar masses. Calculate the wavelength measured by a distant observer using both Newtonian and relativistic approaches for:
   a) r = 100r_s
   b) r = 10r_s
   c) r = 3r_s
   d) r = 2.1r_s

2. **Solution**:
   Newtonian approach: λ_obs/λ_emit = 1/(1 - GM/rc²)
   Relativistic approach: λ_obs/λ_emit = 1/√(1 - 2GM/rc²)

   a) At r = 100r_s = 100(2GM/c²):
      Newtonian: λ_obs = 500 nm/(1 - 1/100) = 505.1 nm
      Relativistic: λ_obs = 500 nm/√(1 - 2/100) = 505.1 nm
      Difference: 0.0 nm (0.0%)

   b) At r = 10r_s = 10(2GM/c²):
      Newtonian: λ_obs = 500 nm/(1 - 1/10) = 555.6 nm
      Relativistic: λ_obs = 500 nm/√(1 - 2/10) = 527.0 nm
      Difference: 28.6 nm (5.4%)

   c) At r = 3r_s = 3(2GM/c²):
      Newtonian: λ_obs = 500 nm/(1 - 1/3) = 750.0 nm
      Relativistic: λ_obs = 500 nm/√(1 - 2/3) = 866.0 nm
      Difference: 116.0 nm (13.4%)

   d) At r = 2.1r_s = 2.1(2GM/c²):
      Newtonian: λ_obs = 500 nm/(1 - 1/2.1) = 1050.0 nm
      Relativistic: λ_obs = 500 nm/√(1 - 2/2.1) = 1581.1 nm
      Difference: 531.1 nm (33.6%)

3. **Discussion**:
   - For r ≫ r_s, Newtonian and relativistic results agree closely
   - Differences become significant as r approaches r_s
   - Newtonian approach underestimates redshift near the horizon
   - At r = r_s, relativistic redshift becomes infinite while Newtonian remains finite
   - This illustrates the breakdown of Newtonian physics in strong gravitational fields

### Problem 3: Effective Potential Analysis

Analyze particle orbits around a black hole using the effective potential approach:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   Consider a particle with specific angular momentum L = 4GM/c orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole:
   a) Find the radius of the circular orbit
   b) Determine if this orbit is stable
   c) Calculate the orbital energy
   d) Compare with Newtonian predictions

2. **Solution**:
   a) Circular orbit radius:
      For relativistic case, solve:
      dV_eff/dr = 0
      where V_eff(r) = (1 - 2GM/rc²)[(L/r)² + 1]
      
      This gives:
      r_circ = L²/2GM · [1 ± √(1 - 12(GM/Lc)²)]
      
      With L = 4GM/c:
      r_circ = (16G²M²/c²)/2GM · [1 ± √(1 - 12(GM/4GM)²)]
      = 8GM/c² · [1 ± √(1 - 3/4)]
      = 8GM/c² · [1 ± 0.5]
      
      Two solutions: r = 12GM/c² and r = 4GM/c²
      
   b) Stability:
      Check d²V_eff/dr² at each radius:
      For r = 12GM/c²: d²V_eff/dr² > 0 (stable)
      For r = 4GM/c²: d²V_eff/dr² < 0 (unstable)
      
   c) Orbital energy:
      E = (1 - 2GM/rc²)/√(1 - 3GM/rc²)
      
      For r = 12GM/c²:
      E = (1 - 2GM/(12GM/c²)c²)/√(1 - 3GM/(12GM/c²)c²)
      = (1 - 1/6)/√(1 - 1/4)
      = (5/6)/√(3/4)
      = (5/6)/(√3/2)
      = 5√3/9 ≈ 0.9623
      
      For r = 4GM/c²:
      E = (1 - 2GM/(4GM/c²)c²)/√(1 - 3GM/(4GM/c²)c²)
      = (1 - 1/2)/√(1 - 3/4)
      = (1/2)/√(1/4)
      = (1/2)/0.5
      = 1
      
   d) Newtonian comparison:
      Newtonian circular orbit:
      r_circ = L²/GM
      
      With L = 4GM/c:
      r_circ = (16G²M²/c²)/GM = 16GM/c²
      
      Newtonian orbital energy:
      E_Newt = 1 - GM/2r_circ
      
      For r = 16GM/c²:
      E_Newt = 1 - GM/(2·16GM/c²) = 1 - c²/32 ≈ 0.9969

3. **Discussion**:
   - Relativistic effects create two possible circular orbits for the same angular momentum
   - The outer orbit (r = 12GM/c²) is stable, the inner orbit (r = 4GM/c²) is unstable
   - The unstable orbit has exactly E = 1 (marginally bound)
   - Newtonian physics predicts only one circular orbit at r = 16GM/c²
   - The relativistic stable orbit is at a smaller radius than the Newtonian prediction
   - The relativistic orbital energy is lower than the Newtonian prediction

### Problem 4: Photon Deflection

Calculate the deflection of light passing near a black hole using simplified approaches:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   A light ray passes a black hole with impact parameter b. Calculate the deflection angle using:
   a) Newtonian approach
   b) Einstein's formula
   c) Compare results for b = 10GM/c²
   d) Find the impact parameter for which the deflection angle is 1 degree

2. **Solution**:
   a) Newtonian approach:
      Treating light as particles affected by Newtonian gravity:
      α_Newton = 2GM/bc²
      
   b) Einstein's formula:
      From general relativity:
      α_Einstein = 4GM/bc²
      
   c) For b = 10GM/c²:
      α_Newton = 2GM/(10GM/c²)c² = 0.2 radians = 11.5 degrees
      α_Einstein = 4GM/(10GM/c²)c² = 0.4 radians = 22.9 degrees
      
   d) For α = 1 degree = 0.01745 radians:
      Using Einstein's formula:
      0.01745 = 4GM/bc²
      b = 4GM/(0.01745c²) = 229GM/c²

3. **Discussion**:
   - Einstein's formula predicts exactly twice the deflection of the Newtonian calculation
   - This factor of 2 difference was crucial in the 1919 solar eclipse observations that confirmed general relativity
   - For small deflection angles (b ≫ GM/c²), Einstein's formula is accurate
   - For light passing very close to the black hole (b ≈ 3√3 GM/c²), more exact calculations are needed
   - The deflection angle diverges as b approaches the critical impact parameter 3√3 GM/c²

### Problem 5: Accretion Disk Properties

Use simplified models to calculate properties of an accretion disk around a black hole:

1. **Problem Statement**:
   A black hole with mass M = 10⁸ solar masses accretes matter at a rate Ṁ = 1 solar mass per year. Using the thin disk model:
   a) Calculate the inner radius of the disk
   b) Calculate the temperature at the inner edge
   c) Calculate the peak wavelength of emission
   d) Calculate the total luminosity
   e) Compare with the Eddington luminosity

2. **Solution**:
   a) Inner radius (ISCO):
      r_in = 6GM/c²
      = 6(6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg·s²)(10⁸ × 1.99 × 10³⁰ kg)/(3 × 10⁸ m/s)²
      = 8.85 × 10¹³ m = 5.92 AU
      
   b) Temperature at inner edge:
      T(r_in) = [3GMṀ/8πσr_in³]^(1/4)
      
      Ṁ = 1 M_☉/year = (1.99 × 10³⁰ kg)/(3.15 × 10⁷ s) = 6.32 × 10²² kg/s
      
      T(r_in) = [3(6.67 × 10⁻¹¹)(10⁸ × 1.99 × 10³⁰)(6.32 × 10²²)/(8π(5.67 × 10⁻⁸)(8.85 × 10¹³)³)]^(1/4)
      = [1.26 × 10²⁰/3.93 × 10³⁴]^(1/4)
      = [3.21 × 10⁻¹⁵]^(1/4)
      = 7.54 × 10⁻⁴ K = 75,400 K
      
   c) Peak wavelength (Wien's law):
      λ_peak = 2.898 × 10⁻³ m·K/T
      = 2.898 × 10⁻³ m·K/75,400 K
      = 3.84 × 10⁻⁸ m = 38.4 nm (extreme ultraviolet)
      
   d) Total luminosity:
      L = ηṀc²
      
      For non-rotating black hole, η ≈ 0.057
      
      L = 0.057(6.32 × 10²² kg/s)(3 × 10⁸ m/s)²
      = 0.057(5.69 × 10³⁹ W)
      = 3.24 × 10³⁸ W
      = 8.44 × 10¹¹ L_☉
      
   e) Eddington luminosity:
      L_Edd = 4πGMm_pc/σ_T
      = 4π(6.67 × 10⁻¹¹)(10⁸ × 1.99 × 10³⁰)(1.67 × 10⁻²⁷)(3 × 10⁸)/(6.65 × 10⁻²⁹)
      = 1.26 × 10³⁹ W
      = 3.28 × 10¹² L_☉
      
      L/L_Edd = 8.44 × 10¹¹/3.28 × 10¹² = 0.26

3. **Discussion**:
   - The accretion disk extends inward to the ISCO at 6GM/c²
   - The inner edge is the hottest part of the disk
   - The disk emits primarily in the ultraviolet and soft X-ray bands
   - The luminosity is substantial but below the Eddington limit
   - This represents a moderately luminous active galactic nucleus
   - The simplified thin disk model is applicable since L < L_Edd
