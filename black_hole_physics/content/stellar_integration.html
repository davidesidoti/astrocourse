  <p>Black holes don't exist in isolation - they represent the final evolutionary stage of the most massive stars in our universe. To understand the complete lifecycle that leads to black hole formation, explore our <a href="../stellar_astrophysics/content/section9_stellar_endpoints.md">Stellar Endpoints</a> section in the Stellar Astrophysics module, which covers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The complete stellar evolutionary pathway from massive stars to black holes</li>
    <li>Comparison with other stellar endpoints (white dwarfs and neutron stars)</li>
    <li>Observational methods for detecting stellar-mass black holes</li>
    <li>The role of supernovae in black hole formation</li>
    <li>Binary systems containing black holes</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Understanding the stellar origins of black holes provides crucial context for the physics concepts explored in this module.</p>
