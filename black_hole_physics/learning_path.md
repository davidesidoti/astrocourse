# Learning Path: Black Hole Physics

This learning path guide will help you navigate through the interconnected modules related to black hole physics in our course. Follow this recommended sequence to build your knowledge progressively from foundational concepts to advanced topics.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into black hole physics, we recommend familiarity with:

1. **Basic Mathematics**
   - Calculus (differentiation and integration)
   - Vector calculus
   - Differential equations

2. **Physics Foundations**
   - Classical mechanics
   - Gravitational forces
   - Special relativity basics

## Recommended Learning Sequence

### 1. Physics Module Foundations
Start with these sections from the Physics Module to build necessary background:
- [Classical Mechanics](../physics/content/section2.md) - Understand gravitational forces and orbital dynamics
- [Oscillations and Waves](../physics/content/section5.md) - Important for understanding gravitational waves
- [Modern Physics](../physics/content/section9.md) - Introduction to relativity concepts

### 2. Stellar Astrophysics Context
Learn about the stellar origins of black holes:
- [Stellar Evolution](../stellar_astrophysics/content/section3_stellar_evolution.md) - How stars evolve over time
- [Stellar Endpoints](../stellar_astrophysics/content/section9_stellar_endpoints.md) - The final stages of massive stars

### 3. Black Hole Physics Core Content
Now progress through the Black Hole Physics Module in sequence:
- [Event Horizons and Singularities](section1_event_horizons.md) - Fundamental concepts
- [Simplified Mathematical Models](section2_simplified_mathematical_models.md) - Accessible approaches

- [Common Misconceptions](section8_common_misconceptions.md) - Clarifying confusions
- [Information Paradox](section9_information_paradox.md) - Frontier research questions

### 4. Interactive Explorations
Enhance your understanding with these interactive elements:
- [Schwarzschild Black Hole Visualization](../interactive/schwarzschild_visualization.html)
- [Kerr Black Hole Visualization](../interactive/kerr_visualization.html)
- [Hawking Radiation Simulator](../interactive/hawking_radiation_simulator.html)

### 5. Advanced Topics
For deeper exploration:
- Return to the Physics Module for more on [General Relativity](../physics/content/section9.md)
- Explore [Gravitational Wave Astronomy](../stellar_astrophysics/content/section10_variable_stars.md) in the Stellar Astrophysics Module

## Knowledge Assessment
