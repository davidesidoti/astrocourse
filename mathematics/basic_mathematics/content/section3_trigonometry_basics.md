# Trigonometry Basics

## Introduction to Trigonometry in Astronomy

Trigonometry—the study of triangles and the relationships between their sides and angles—is one of the oldest and most fundamental branches of mathematics in astronomy. From the ancient measurements of Earth's circumference to modern calculations of spacecraft trajectories, trigonometric principles have been essential tools for understanding the cosmos.

### What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll master the fundamental concepts of trigonometry with a focus on their astronomical applications. We'll explore angle measurements, trigonometric functions, identities, and methods for solving triangles. You'll learn how these mathematical tools help astronomers measure distances, analyze periodic phenomena, and navigate celestial coordinate systems.

### Why It Matters

Trigonometry provides the mathematical foundation for countless astronomical calculations:
- Determining distances to celestial objects
- Mapping positions on the celestial sphere
- Analyzing orbital mechanics
- Modeling periodic phenomena like stellar pulsations
- Converting between different coordinate systems
- Calculating angular sizes and separations

The ability to apply trigonometric principles is essential for understanding both the geometric and dynamic aspects of astronomy.

### Historical Context

Trigonometry and astronomy have been intertwined throughout history:

- Ancient Babylonian astronomers (c. 1800 BCE) created tables of measurements that contained implicit trigonometric functions
- Hipparchus (c. 190-120 BCE), often called the "father of trigonometry," created the first known table of chords—an early version of the sine function
- Ptolemy's *Almagest* (c. 150 CE) contained extensive trigonometric tables used for astronomical calculations
- Islamic mathematicians like al-Khwārizmī and al-Battani (8th-9th centuries) advanced trigonometry and applied it to astronomy
- Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo all relied heavily on trigonometry for their revolutionary astronomical discoveries

This rich historical connection continues today, with trigonometry remaining indispensable in modern astronomical research and space exploration.

</div>

## Angles and Their Measurement

### Angle Concepts

An angle is formed by two rays (half-lines) sharing a common endpoint called the vertex. Angles measure the amount of rotation between these rays.

In astronomy, angles are used to describe:
- The apparent separation between celestial objects
- The apparent size (angular diameter) of objects
- Positions in coordinate systems
- Phases in periodic cycles
- Inclinations of orbits

### Degree Measure

The degree is a unit of angle measurement based on dividing a complete circle into 360 equal parts. This system originated in ancient Babylon and remains widely used in astronomy.

Subdivisions of degrees include:
- Minutes of arc (arcminutes): 1° = 60 arcminutes (denoted by ′)
- Seconds of arc (arcseconds): 1′ = 60 arcseconds (denoted by ″)

These smaller units are crucial in astronomy, where precise angular measurements are often needed:
- The Moon's angular diameter is about 31 arcminutes (0.52°)
- The angular resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope is about 0.05 arcseconds
- The nearest star (Proxima Centauri) has a parallax of 0.77 arcseconds

### Radian Measure

The radian is the standard unit of angle measurement in mathematics and physics. One radian is the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc whose length equals the radius of the circle.

Key relationships:
- 2π radians = 360 degrees (a complete circle)
- 1 radian ≈ 57.3 degrees
- π radians = 180 degrees

To convert between degrees and radians:
- Degrees to radians: multiply by π/180
- Radians to degrees: multiply by 180/π

Radians are particularly useful in astronomy because they create simple relationships between angles, arc lengths, and areas in circular motion.

### Arc Length

The relationship between angle (in radians), radius, and arc length is:

s = rθ

Where:
- s is the arc length
- r is the radius
- θ is the angle in radians

This formula is used to calculate distances along circular paths, such as the distance traveled by a planet in a portion of its orbit.

### Angular Diameter

The angular diameter (or angular size) of an object is the angle subtended by the object at the point of observation. It depends on both the actual size of the object and its distance:

θ = arctan(d/D) ≈ d/D (for small angles)

Where:
- θ is the angular diameter (in radians)
- d is the actual diameter of the object
- D is the distance to the object

The small-angle approximation (θ ≈ d/D) is valid for most astronomical observations where the angle is less than a few degrees.

<div class="concept-check">

<p>2. Convert this to degrees.</p>
<p>3. Express this in arcminutes.</p>
</div>

### Astronomical Application: Angular Measurements in Telescope Observations

Astronomers routinely work with extremely small angles. For example:
- The angular resolution of a telescope (its ability to distinguish nearby objects) is approximately θ = 1.22λ/D, where λ is the wavelength of light and D is the telescope diameter
- The parallax of stars (the apparent shift in position due to Earth's orbit) is typically measured in milliarcseconds
- The proper motion of stars (their actual movement across the sky) is often just a few arcseconds per year

These tiny angular measurements allow astronomers to determine vast distances and detect subtle celestial movements.

## The Unit Circle

### Definition and Properties

The unit circle is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin of a coordinate system. It serves as the fundamental geometric model for understanding trigonometric functions.

Key properties:
- Circumference = 2π
- Area = π
- Any point on the unit circle is at distance 1 from the origin
- The equation of the unit circle is x² + y² = 1

The unit circle provides a geometric interpretation of trigonometric functions and helps visualize their properties.

### Coordinates on the Unit Circle

For any angle θ, we can find a corresponding point on the unit circle by moving θ radians counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. The coordinates of this point are:

(x, y) = (cos θ, sin θ)

This relationship defines the sine and cosine functions geometrically:
- cos θ is the x-coordinate of the point on the unit circle at angle θ
- sin θ is the y-coordinate of the point on the unit circle at angle θ

These coordinates satisfy the Pythagorean identity: sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, which is a direct consequence of the unit circle equation x² + y² = 1.

### Reference Angles

A reference angle is the acute angle (≤ 90°) formed by the terminal side of an angle and the x-axis. Reference angles help find trigonometric values for angles in different quadrants.

For an angle θ in:
- Quadrant I (0° to 90°): reference angle = θ
- Quadrant II (90° to 180°): reference angle = 180° - θ
- Quadrant III (180° to 270°): reference angle = θ - 180°
- Quadrant IV (270° to 360°): reference angle = 360° - θ

The signs of trigonometric functions depend on the quadrant:

| Quadrant | sin θ | cos θ | tan θ |
|----------|-------|-------|-------|
| I        | +     | +     | +     |
| II       | +     | -     | -     |
| III      | -     | -     | +     |
| IV       | -     | +     | -     |

This can be remembered with the mnemonic "All Students Take Calculus" (All = Q1: all positive, Students = Q2: sine positive, Take = Q3: tangent positive, Calculus = Q4: cosine positive).

### Special Angles

Certain angles have exact trigonometric values that can be expressed without calculators:

| Angle (degrees) | Angle (radians) | sin θ | cos θ | tan θ |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------|-------|-------|
| 0°              | 0               | 0     | 1     | 0     |
| 30°             | π/6             | 1/2   | √3/2  | 1/√3  |
| 45°             | π/4             | 1/√2  | 1/√2  | 1     |
| 60°             | π/3             | √3/2  | 1/2   | √3    |
| 90°             | π/2             | 1     | 0     | undef |

These values are derived from right triangles with special properties, such as the 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 triangles.

<div class="math-helper">
<h4>Math Helper: Memorizing Special Angles</h4>

<p>Think of the sequence 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and divide each by 4:</p>
<p>sin(0°) = 0/4 = 0</p>
<p>sin(30°) = 1/4 × 2 = 1/2</p>
<p>sin(45°) = 2/4 × √2 = √2/2 = 1/√2</p>
<p>sin(60°) = 3/4 × 2/√3 = √3/2</p>
<p>sin(90°) = 4/4 = 1</p>
<p>For cosine values, the pattern is reversed (starting from cos(0°) = 1).</p>
</div>

### Astronomical Application: Circular Motion of Celestial Bodies

The unit circle is fundamental to understanding circular and elliptical orbits. For a body in circular orbit:

- Its position at time t can be described as (r·cos(ωt), r·sin(ωt)), where r is the orbital radius and ω is the angular velocity
- The period P of the orbit is related to ω by ω = 2π/P
- The body completes one full orbit when the angle increases by 2π radians

For example, Earth's position in its orbit (simplified as circular) can be approximated using the unit circle model, with the Sun at the origin and the angle increasing by about 0.0172 radians (≈ 1°) per day.

## Trigonometric Functions

### Sine Function

The sine function (sin θ) represents the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle, or the y-coordinate on the unit circle.

Properties:
- Domain: all real numbers
- Range: [-1, 1]
- Period: 2π (or 360°)
- Odd function: sin(-θ) = -sin(θ)
- Zeros at θ = 0, π, 2π, ... (or 0°, 180°, 360°, ...)

The graph of y = sin θ is a wave that oscillates between -1 and 1, representing many natural phenomena with periodic behavior.

### Cosine Function

The cosine function (cos θ) represents the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle, or the x-coordinate on the unit circle.

Properties:
- Domain: all real numbers
- Range: [-1, 1]
- Period: 2π (or 360°)
- Even function: cos(-θ) = cos(θ)
- Zeros at θ = π/2, 3π/2, 5π/2, ... (or 90°, 270°, 450°, ...)

The cosine function is identical to the sine function but shifted by π/2 radians (90°): cos θ = sin(θ + π/2).

### Tangent Function

The tangent function (tan θ) represents the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle, or the slope of the line from the origin to the point on the unit circle.

Properties:
- Domain: all real numbers except θ = π/2 + nπ (or 90° + n·180°), where n is an integer
- Range: all real numbers
- Period: π (or 180°)
- Odd function: tan(-θ) = -tan(θ)
- Zeros at θ = 0, π, 2π, ... (or 0°, 180°, 360°, ...)

The tangent function can be defined in terms of sine and cosine: tan θ = sin θ / cos θ.

### Reciprocal Functions

The remaining three trigonometric functions are reciprocals of the primary functions:

- Cosecant: csc θ = 1/sin θ
- Secant: sec θ = 1/cos θ
- Cotangent: cot θ = 1/tan θ = cos θ/sin θ

These functions are less commonly used in basic astronomy but appear in more advanced calculations.

### Domains and Ranges

Understanding the domains and ranges of trigonometric functions is crucial for their proper application:

- Sine and cosine are defined for all angles and always produce values between -1 and 1
- Tangent is undefined when cos θ = 0 (at 90°, 270°, etc.) and can produce any real number
- Cosecant is undefined when sin θ = 0 (at 0°, 180°, etc.) and has range (-∞, -1] ∪ [1, ∞)
- Secant is undefined when cos θ = 0 (at 90°, 270°, etc.) and has range (-∞, -1] ∪ [1, ∞)
- Cotangent is undefined when sin θ = 0 (at 0°, 180°, etc.) and can produce any real number

</div>

### Astronomical Application: Modeling Periodic Phenomena

Trigonometric functions are ideal for modeling periodic astronomical phenomena:

- **Variable star brightness**: The light curve of a pulsating variable star like a Cepheid can be modeled using sine or cosine functions
- **Planetary temperatures**: Seasonal temperature variations on planets follow approximately sinusoidal patterns
- **Tidal forces**: The strength of tides varies sinusoidally with a period of approximately 12.5 hours (on Earth)
- **Solar activity**: The 11-year sunspot cycle can be approximated using trigonometric functions

For example, the brightness variation of a Cepheid variable star might be modeled as:

B(t) = B₀ + A·sin(2πt/P)

Where:
- B(t) is the brightness at time t
- B₀ is the average brightness
- A is the amplitude of variation
- P is the period of pulsation

This mathematical description allows astronomers to determine the star's intrinsic properties and use it as a "standard candle" for distance measurements.

## Trigonometric Identities

### Fundamental Identities

Trigonometric identities are equations involving trigonometric functions that are true for all values in their domains. The fundamental identities include:

**Pythagorean Identities**:
- sin²θ + cos²θ = 1
- 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ
- 1 + cot²θ = csc²θ

**Quotient Identities**:
- tan θ = sin θ / cos θ
- cot θ = cos θ / sin θ

**Reciprocal Identities**:
- sin θ = 1/csc θ
- cos θ = 1/sec θ
- tan θ = 1/cot θ

**Parity Identities** (behavior with negative angles):
- sin(-θ) = -sin θ (odd function)
- cos(-θ) = cos θ (even function)
- tan(-θ) = -tan θ (odd function)

These identities form the foundation for manipulating and simplifying trigonometric expressions in astronomical calculations.

### Sum and Difference Formulas

These formulas express the trigonometric functions of sums or differences of angles in terms of the functions of the individual angles:

**Sine**:
- sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B
- sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B

**Cosine**:
- cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B
- cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B

**Tangent**:
- tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B) / (1 - tan A tan B)
- tan(A - B) = (tan A - tan B) / (1 + tan A tan B)

These formulas are particularly useful in astronomy for combining multiple periodic effects or analyzing complex orbital motions.

### Double-Angle Formulas

Double-angle formulas express trigonometric functions of twice an angle in terms of functions of the original angle:

- sin(2A) = 2 sin A cos A
- cos(2A) = cos²A - sin²A = 2cos²A - 1 = 1 - 2sin²A
- tan(2A) = 2 tan A / (1 - tan²A)

These formulas help analyze phenomena with frequency doubling or harmonic relationships, such as certain types of orbital resonances.

### Half-Angle Formulas

Half-angle formulas express trigonometric functions of half an angle in terms of functions of the original angle:

- sin(A/2) = ±√[(1 - cos A)/2]
- cos(A/2) = ±√[(1 + cos A)/2]
- tan(A/2) = (1 - cos A)/sin A = sin A/(1 + cos A)

The sign depends on the quadrant in which A/2 lies.

These formulas are useful when analyzing phenomena that occur at half the frequency of a primary cycle.

### Product-to-Sum Formulas

These formulas convert products of trigonometric functions to sums:

- sin A sin B = ½[cos(A - B) - cos(A + B)]
- cos A cos B = ½[cos(A - B) + cos(A + B)]
- sin A cos B = ½[sin(A + B) + sin(A - B)]

These transformations are valuable in analyzing combined periodic effects, such as the interaction of multiple orbital periods or wave phenomena.

<div class="common-misconception">
<h4>Common Misconception</h4>
<p>A common error is confusing the sum of angles formula with direct addition of functions. For example:</p>
<p>sin(A + B) ≠ sin A + sin B</p>
<p>This distinction is crucial in astronomy when analyzing combined periodic effects, such as when multiple orbital frequencies interact.</p>
</div>

### Astronomical Application: Simplifying Complex Calculations

Trigonometric identities are essential tools for simplifying astronomical calculations. For example, when analyzing the combined effect of Earth's rotation and revolution on the position of a star, astronomers use sum and difference formulas to express the star's apparent position.

Similarly, when calculating the gravitational effect of multiple bodies in complex arrangements (such as the Sun-Earth-Moon system), trigonometric identities help simplify the vector components of forces and accelerations.

## Solving Triangles

### Right Triangles

A right triangle has one angle of 90° (π/2 radians). In a right triangle with an acute angle θ:

- sin θ = opposite/hypotenuse
- cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse
- tan θ = opposite/adjacent

These relationships, along with the Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse), allow us to solve for unknown sides and angles in right triangles.

Example: If we know one acute angle and one side of a right triangle, we can find the other sides using these ratios.

### Law of Sines

The Law of Sines applies to any triangle (not just right triangles) and states:

sin A/a = sin B/b = sin C/c

Where A, B, and C are the angles of the triangle, and a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides opposite to those angles, respectively.

This law is particularly useful when we know:
- Two angles and one side (AAS or ASA)
- Two sides and the angle opposite one of them (SSA, which may have multiple solutions)

### Law of Cosines

The Law of Cosines applies to any triangle and states:

c² = a² + b² - 2ab cos C

Where a, b, and c are the sides of the triangle, and C is the angle opposite to side c.

This law is particularly useful when we know:
- Three sides (SSS)
- Two sides and the included angle (SAS)

The Law of Cosines generalizes the Pythagorean theorem to non-right triangles.

### Area of a Triangle

Several formulas can calculate the area of a triangle:

- **Basic formula**: Area = ½ × base × height
- **Using sine**: Area = ½ × a × b × sin C (where C is the included angle between sides a and b)
- **Heron's formula**: Area = √[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)], where s = (a+b+c)/2 is the semi-perimeter

These formulas are used to calculate areas of regions on celestial bodies or cross-sections of astronomical objects.

<li><strong>Two sides and the angle opposite one of them (SSA)</strong>: Use the Law of Sines (check for multiple solutions)</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Astronomical Application: Determining Distances and Sizes

Triangulation is a fundamental technique in astronomy for determining distances:

**Parallax Method**: By observing a nearby star from different positions in Earth's orbit, astronomers create a triangle where:
- The baseline is Earth's orbital diameter (2 AU)
- The parallax angle p is half the apparent shift in the star's position
- The distance d to the star is given by d = 1/p (when p is measured in arcseconds and d in parsecs)

**Radar Ranging**: By sending radio signals to planets and measuring the time for the echo to return:
- The distance is calculated using d = c·t/2, where c is the speed of light and t is the round-trip time
- This creates a triangle between Earth, the target planet, and the Sun

**Angular Size Method**: By measuring the angular size θ of an object with known physical size d:
- The distance D can be calculated using θ = d/D (for small angles, with θ in radians)
- This technique is used for determining distances to galaxies using standard candles of known size

## Inverse Trigonometric Functions

### Arcsine, Arccosine, Arctangent

Inverse trigonometric functions "undo" the regular trigonometric functions, returning the angle that would produce a given trigonometric value:

- Arcsine (sin⁻¹ or arcsin): Returns the angle whose sine is a given value
- Arccosine (cos⁻¹ or arccos): Returns the angle whose cosine is a given value
- Arctangent (tan⁻¹ or arctan): Returns the angle whose tangent is a given value

These functions are essential for finding angles from observed ratios or measurements in astronomy.

### Domains and Ranges

Due to the periodic nature of trigonometric functions, their inverses must have restricted domains and ranges to be well-defined:

**Arcsine (sin⁻¹)**:
- Domain: [-1, 1]
- Range: [-π/2, π/2] or [-90°, 90°]

**Arccosine (cos⁻¹)**:
- Domain: [-1, 1]
- Range: [0, π] or [0°, 180°]

**Arctangent (tan⁻¹)**:
- Domain: all real numbers
- Range: (-π/2, π/2) or (-90°, 90°)

These restrictions ensure that each input has exactly one output.

### Compositions

When composing a trigonometric function with its inverse, the result depends on the order and the value:

- sin(arcsin x) = x for all x in [-1, 1]
- arcsin(sin θ) = θ only for θ in [-π/2, π/2]

Similar relationships exist for cosine and tangent. Understanding these composition properties helps verify calculations and recognize when simplifications are possible.

### Astronomical Application: Finding Angles from Observed Measurements

Inverse trigonometric functions are used extensively in astronomy to determine angles from various measurements:

**Inclination of Orbits**: The inclination i of a planet's orbit can be found using arccos:
- i = arccos(h·n), where h is the angular momentum vector and n is the reference plane normal

**Stellar Parallax**: The distance to a star in parsecs is d = 1/p, where p is the parallax angle in arcseconds. To find the angle from the distance:
- p = arcsin(1 AU/d) ≈ 1 AU/d (for small angles)

**Position Angle**: The orientation of one celestial object relative to another is often expressed as a position angle θ, calculated using arctangent:
- θ = arctan2(Δy, Δx), where Δx and Δy are the differences in coordinates

The arctan2 function (available in most programming languages and scientific calculators) is a variation of arctangent that considers the signs of both inputs to return the angle in the correct quadrant.

## Periodic Phenomena and Trigonometric Functions

### Amplitude, Period, Phase Shift

Trigonometric functions can be modified to model a wide range of periodic phenomena:

**General Form**:
- y = A sin(Bx - C) + D or
- y = A cos(Bx - C) + D

Where:
- A is the amplitude (half the distance between maximum and minimum values)
- B affects the period (period = 2π/B)
- C/B is the phase shift (horizontal displacement)
- D is the vertical shift (midline of the oscillation)

These parameters allow trigonometric functions to model various oscillatory behaviors in astronomy.

### General Form

The general form of a sinusoidal function provides flexibility to model diverse periodic phenomena:

- The amplitude A determines the intensity or magnitude of the variation
- The period 2π/B determines how quickly the cycle repeats
- The phase shift C/B determines when peaks and troughs occur
- The vertical shift D determines the average or equilibrium value

By adjusting these parameters, astronomers can create mathematical models that accurately represent periodic astronomical processes.

### Modeling Oscillations

To model an oscillation using trigonometric functions:

1. Identify the average value (vertical shift D)
2. Determine the amplitude A from the maximum deviation from average
3. Find the period 2π/B by measuring the time between peaks
4. Determine the phase shift C/B by noting when the first peak occurs

This process creates a mathematical description that can be used for prediction, analysis, and comparison with theoretical models.

<p>2. What will the star's magnitude be 12.5 days from now?</p>
<p>3. When will the star next reach its maximum brightness?</p>
</div>

### Astronomical Application: Stellar Pulsations, Planetary Orbits, Light Curves

Trigonometric functions are ideal for modeling numerous astronomical phenomena:

**Stellar Pulsations**: Many stars, like Cepheid variables, pulsate with regular periods. Their radius can be modeled as:
- R(t) = R₀ + ΔR·sin(2πt/P + φ), where R₀ is the average radius, ΔR is the amplitude of pulsation, P is the period, and φ is the phase

**Planetary Temperatures**: The seasonal temperature variation at a location on a planet follows:
- T(t) = T₀ + ΔT·sin(2πt/P + φ), where T₀ is the average temperature, ΔT is the amplitude of variation, P is the orbital period, and φ depends on the starting season

**Light Curves**: The brightness variation of eclipsing binary stars can be modeled with modified sinusoidal functions, helping astronomers determine orbital parameters and stellar properties

**Exoplanet Detection**: The radial velocity method for detecting exoplanets analyzes the periodic Doppler shift in a star's spectrum, which follows a sinusoidal pattern due to the star's motion around the system's center of mass

## Polar Coordinates

### Polar Coordinate System

The polar coordinate system represents points in a plane using:
- r: the distance from the origin
- θ: the angle from the positive x-axis (usually measured counterclockwise)

This system is particularly well-suited for describing circular and spiral paths, making it valuable in astronomy for representing orbits and spiral structures.

### Converting Between Polar and Cartesian Coordinates

To convert from polar coordinates (r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y):
- x = r cos θ
- y = r sin θ

To convert from Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ):
- r = √(x² + y²)
- θ = arctan(y/x) (with appropriate quadrant adjustments)

These conversions are frequently used in astronomical calculations when switching between different ways of representing positions.

### Polar Equations

Many astronomical curves have simple representations in polar coordinates:

**Circle**: r = a (constant)
- Represents circular orbits or equidistant points from a center

**Ellipse**: r = ed/(1 + e cos θ)
- Describes planetary orbits according to Kepler's laws
- e is the eccentricity, d is a parameter related to the semi-major axis

**Spiral**: r = aθ (Archimedean spiral) or r = ae^(bθ) (logarithmic spiral)
- Models spiral arms in galaxies
- Describes certain types of orbital decay

**Cardioid**: r = a(1 + cos θ)
- Appears in certain radiation patterns and gravitational scenarios

These equations provide compact and elegant descriptions of complex astronomical shapes.

### Astronomical Application: Describing Orbital Paths, Spiral Galaxies

Polar coordinates are ideal for describing various astronomical structures:

**Planetary Orbits**: Kepler's first law states that planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus. The polar equation of this orbit is:
- r = a(1-e²)/(1+e cos θ), where a is the semi-major axis and e is the eccentricity

**Spiral Galaxies**: The arms of spiral galaxies often follow logarithmic spirals with the equation:
- r = r₀e^(kθ), where r₀ is the starting radius and k controls the tightness of the spiral

**Radiation Patterns**: The intensity of radiation from certain astronomical sources follows patterns easily described in polar coordinates

**Tidal Forces**: The strength of tidal forces around a massive body can be visualized using polar plots

## Spherical Trigonometry

### Spherical Coordinates

Spherical coordinates extend polar coordinates to three dimensions, using:
- r: the distance from the origin
- θ (theta): the polar angle from the positive z-axis (colatitude, ranging from 0 to π)
- φ (phi): the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane from the x-axis (longitude, ranging from 0 to 2π)

In astronomy, modified versions of this system are used for celestial coordinates:
- The equatorial coordinate system uses right ascension (α) and declination (δ)
- The horizontal coordinate system uses azimuth and altitude
- The ecliptic coordinate system uses ecliptic longitude and latitude

### Great Circles and Spherical Triangles

A great circle is the intersection of a sphere with a plane passing through the sphere's center. Great circles represent the shortest path between two points on a sphere.

A spherical triangle is formed by the arcs of three great circles on a sphere. Unlike plane triangles:
- The sum of angles in a spherical triangle exceeds 180° (the excess depends on the triangle's area)
- The sides are measured as angles (the angle subtended at the center of the sphere)
- The area is proportional to the angular excess: Area = R²(A + B + C - π), where R is the sphere's radius

These concepts are fundamental to celestial navigation and coordinate transformations in astronomy.

### Spherical Law of Sines and Cosines

The spherical law of sines states:
- sin a/sin A = sin b/sin B = sin c/sin C

Where a, b, c are the sides of the spherical triangle (measured as angles), and A, B, C are the angles between the sides.

The spherical law of cosines for sides states:
- cos c = cos a cos b + sin a sin b cos C

And for angles:
- cos C = -cos A cos B + sin A sin B cos c

These laws are essential for solving problems involving positions on the celestial sphere.

### Astronomical Application: Celestial Coordinate Systems, Navigation by Stars

Spherical trigonometry is the mathematical foundation of astronomical coordinate systems:

**Coordinate Transformations**: Converting between different celestial coordinate systems (equatorial, horizontal, ecliptic) requires spherical trigonometry. For example, to convert from equatorial coordinates (α, δ) to horizontal coordinates (A, h):
- sin h = sin φ sin δ + cos φ cos δ cos(LST - α)
- sin A = -cos δ sin(LST - α)/cos h

Where φ is the observer's latitude and LST is the local sidereal time.

**Angular Separations**: The angular distance between two celestial objects with coordinates (α₁, δ₁) and (α₂, δ₂) is:
- cos d = sin δ₁ sin δ₂ + cos δ₁ cos δ₂ cos(α₁ - α₂)

**Precession and Nutation**: The slow changes in Earth's rotational axis are calculated using spherical trigonometry

**Star Navigation**: Traditional celestial navigation uses spherical trigonometry to determine position based on star sightings
