# Section 1: Introduction to Calculus Outline

## Learning Objectives
- Understand what calculus is and why it's important in astronomy
- Develop intuition about rates of change and accumulation
- Grasp the concept of limits and continuity
- Understand the relationship between position, velocity, and acceleration
- See how calculus explains planetary motion
- Prepare for more formal calculus in subsequent sections

## Content Structure

### What is Calculus and Why is it Important in Astronomy?
- Definition of calculus as the mathematics of continuous change
- Two main branches: differential and integral calculus
- Applications in astronomy (motion, evolution, accumulation, modeling, prediction)

### Historical Development of Calculus in Astronomy
- Ancient astronomers and their limitations
- Kepler's empirical laws
- Newton's development of calculus for astronomical problems
- Leibniz's parallel development
- Laplace and mathematical astronomy

### The Concept of Rates of Change
- Average rate of change
- Instantaneous rate of change
- Astronomical example: orbital velocity

### The Concept of Accumulation
- Simple accumulation with constant rates
- Variable rate accumulation
- Astronomical example: total mass from density

### Limits and Continuity Explained Visually
- Intuitive understanding of limits
- Continuity in natural phenomena
- Astronomical examples

### The Relationship Between Position, Velocity, and Acceleration
- Definitions and relationships
- Calculus interpretation (derivatives)
- Graphical interpretation
- Astronomical example: planetary motion
