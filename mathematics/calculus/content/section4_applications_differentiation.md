# Applications of Differentiation

## Optimization Problems

Optimization is about finding the maximum or minimum values of a function. In astronomy, optimization problems arise when we seek the most efficient, extreme, or optimal conditions in various scenarios.

### Finding Critical Points

The first step in optimization is to find the critical points of a function—points where the derivative equals zero or is undefined:

f'(x) = 0   or   f'(x) is undefined

At these points, the function could have a maximum, minimum, or neither (an inflection point).

### Second Derivative Test

To determine whether a critical point is a maximum, minimum, or neither, we use the second derivative test:

- If f''(x) < 0 at a critical point, the function has a local maximum there
- If f''(x) > 0 at a critical point, the function has a local minimum there
- If f''(x) = 0 at a critical point, the test is inconclusive

### Example: Optimal Launch Angle

Consider launching a projectile on a planet with no atmosphere. The horizontal distance traveled depends on the launch angle θ, initial velocity v₀, and gravitational acceleration g:

d = (v₀² sin(2θ))/g

To find the angle that maximizes distance, we differentiate with respect to θ and set equal to zero:

d/dθ = (2v₀² cos(2θ))/g = 0

This gives us 2θ = 90°, so θ = 45°. The second derivative is negative at this point, confirming it's a maximum.

This result is important for mission planning when launching probes or rovers on other celestial bodies.

### Example: Kepler's Wine Barrel Problem

In the 17th century, Kepler posed a problem about finding the barrel shape that maximizes volume for a given surface area—essentially an optimization problem.

For a cylindrical barrel with radius r and height h, the volume is V = πr²h, and the surface area is S = 2πr² + 2πrh.

If we fix S and maximize V, we can use Lagrange multipliers or substitute h in terms of r. The optimal ratio turns out to be h = 2r, meaning the height should equal the diameter.

This principle applies to designing fuel tanks for spacecraft, where mass efficiency is crucial.

### Optimization in Orbital Mechanics

In orbital mechanics, optimization problems include:

1. **Minimum Energy Transfers**: The Hohmann transfer orbit minimizes the energy required to move between two circular orbits. The change in velocity (Δv) is:

   Δv = √(μ/r₁) · (√(2r₂/(r₁+r₂)) - 1) + √(μ/r₂) · (1 - √(2r₁/(r₁+r₂)))

   where μ is the gravitational parameter, r₁ is the initial orbit radius, and r₂ is the final orbit radius.

2. **Optimal Launch Windows**: Finding the dates that minimize fuel requirements for interplanetary missions involves optimizing the phase angle between planets.

3. **Gravity Assists**: Calculating the optimal approach trajectory for a gravity assist maneuver to maximize the velocity gain.

## Related Rates

Related rates problems involve finding how one rate of change relates to another using implicit differentiation and the chain rule.

### The Approach to Related Rates

1. Identify the quantities that are changing and their rates
2. Find an equation relating these quantities
3. Differentiate both sides with respect to time
4. Substitute known values and solve for the unknown rate

### Example: Expanding Supernova Remnant

Consider a spherical supernova remnant expanding at a constant rate of 1000 km/s. How quickly is the volume of the remnant increasing when its radius is 5 light-years?

Step 1: The quantities are radius r (changing at dr/dt = 1000 km/s) and volume V.
Step 2: The equation relating them is V = (4/3)πr³.
Step 3: Differentiating with respect to time:
dV/dt = 4πr² · dr/dt
Step 4: Substituting r = 5 light-years and dr/dt = 1000 km/s (after converting units):
dV/dt = 4π(5 ly)² · 1000 km/s

This calculation helps astronomers understand the evolution of supernova remnants and their impact on the surrounding interstellar medium.

### Example: Binary Star Orbital Changes

In a binary star system, the orbital period P is related to the semi-major axis a by Kepler's third law:

P² = (4π²/G(m₁+m₂)) · a³

If one star is losing mass at a rate dm₁/dt, how does this affect the orbital period?

Differentiating both sides with respect to time and applying the chain rule:

2P · dP/dt = (4π²/G) · [3a²(da/dt)/(m₁+m₂) - a³(dm₁/dt)/(m₁+m₂)²]

This allows astronomers to predict how binary star orbits evolve as stars lose mass through stellar winds or mass transfer.

### Example: Apparent Angular Size

The angular size θ of a celestial object depends on its physical size D and distance r:

θ = 2 arctan(D/2r)

If a spacecraft is approaching a planet at velocity v, how quickly is the planet's angular size changing?

Differentiating with respect to time:

dθ/dt = (2/(1+(D/2r)²)) · (D/2) · (-1/r²) · dr/dt

With dr/dt = -v (negative because distance is decreasing), we can calculate how rapidly the planet appears to grow in the spacecraft's viewport, which is crucial for navigation and imaging.

## Linear Approximation

Linear approximation (also called tangent line approximation) uses the derivative to approximate function values near a known point.

### The Tangent Line Approximation

If we know f(a) and f'(a), we can approximate f(x) for x near a using:

f(x) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)(x - a)

This is the equation of the tangent line to f at x = a.

### Example: Stellar Temperature Estimation

The luminosity L of a star depends on its temperature T according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law:

L = 4πR²σT⁴

where R is the radius and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant.

If we know a star's luminosity at temperature T₀, we can estimate its luminosity at a slightly different temperature T using linear approximation:

L(T) ≈ L(T₀) + (dL/dT)|ₜ₌ₜ₀ · (T - T₀)

where dL/dT = 16πR²σT³.

This approximation is useful when analyzing small temperature variations in variable stars.

### Example: Relativistic Corrections

In Newtonian mechanics, the kinetic energy is K = (1/2)mv². In special relativity, the exact formula is:

K = mc²(γ - 1)

where γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²) is the Lorentz factor.

For velocities much less than the speed of light, we can use linear approximation to show that:

K ≈ (1/2)mv² + (3/8)mv⁴/c² + ...

This demonstrates how relativistic effects become important for high-velocity objects like cosmic rays or particles near black holes.

### Error in Linear Approximation

The error in linear approximation is related to the second derivative:

Error ≈ (f''(ξ)/2)(x - a)²

for some ξ between a and x.

This means the approximation works best when:
1. x is close to a
2. The second derivative is small (the function is not highly curved)

## Mean Value Theorem

The Mean Value Theorem states that if a function f is continuous on [a,b] and differentiable on (a,b), then there exists at least one point c in (a,b) such that:

f'(c) = [f(b) - f(a)]/(b - a)

Geometrically, this means there is at least one point where the tangent to the curve is parallel to the secant line connecting the endpoints.

### Astronomical Applications

1. **Average Velocity vs. Instantaneous Velocity**: If we know a comet's positions at two times, the Mean Value Theorem guarantees that at some point between those times, the comet's instantaneous velocity equals its average velocity over the interval.

2. **Temperature Variations**: If we measure a star's temperature at two times, there must be a moment when the rate of temperature change equals the average rate over the entire period.

3. **Orbital Energy Changes**: When a spacecraft moves from one point in its orbit to another, there must be a position where the rate of energy change equals the average rate for the entire segment.

### Example: Stellar Evolution Rates

Consider a star's temperature T(t) as a function of time. If we measure T(t₁) = 5000K and T(t₂) = 4800K, where t₂ - t₁ = 10⁶ years, the Mean Value Theorem tells us that at some point during this million-year period, the cooling rate was exactly:

dT/dt = [T(t₂) - T(t₁)]/(t₂ - t₁) = -200K/10⁶yr = -2 × 10⁻⁴ K/yr

This helps astronomers understand stellar evolution timescales.

## L'Hôpital's Rule

L'Hôpital's rule is a technique for evaluating limits that result in indeterminate forms like 0/0 or ∞/∞.

### The Rule

If lim(x→a) f(x)/g(x) gives an indeterminate form (0/0 or ∞/∞), then:

lim(x→a) f(x)/g(x) = lim(x→a) f'(x)/g'(x)

provided the limit on the right exists.

### Example: Black Hole Event Horizon

Near a black hole's event horizon, the time dilation factor approaches:

lim(r→rs) √(1 - rs/r)

where rs is the Schwarzschild radius.

As r approaches rs, this becomes an indeterminate form of type 0/0. Using L'Hôpital's rule helps analyze the behavior of physical quantities in this extreme environment.

### Example: Early Universe Expansion

In cosmology, the early universe's expansion can lead to limits of the form:

lim(t→0) t·H(t)

where H(t) is the Hubble parameter. This often gives an indeterminate form that can be resolved using L'Hôpital's rule to understand the universe's behavior near the Big Bang.

### Example: Stellar Luminosity Class

The ratio of certain spectral lines can help determine a star's luminosity class. These ratios sometimes lead to indeterminate forms when analyzing theoretical models at boundary conditions. L'Hôpital's rule helps resolve these cases.

## Concept Check: Applications of Differentiation

Let's test your understanding with some concept check questions:

1. **Question**: A spacecraft is in an elliptical orbit with semi-major axis a. The orbital period P is related to a by P² = ka³, where k is a constant. If a small engine burn increases the semi-major axis at a rate of 2 km/day, how fast is the orbital period changing when a = 10,000 km and P = 2 hours?
   
   **Solution**: Using the chain rule:
   dP/dt = (dP/da)(da/dt)
   
   From P² = ka³, we get:
   2P(dP/dt) = 3ka²(da/dt)
   
   Solving for dP/dt:
   dP/dt = (3ka²/2P)(da/dt) = (3P²/2Pa)(da/dt) = (3P/2a)(da/dt)
   
   Substituting the values:
   dP/dt = (3(2 hours)/(2(10,000 km)))(2 km/day) = (6 hours)/(20,000 km) · (2 km/day)
   
   After converting units:
   dP/dt = 0.0006 hours/day = 0.036 minutes/day

2. **Question**: The luminosity of a star is L = 4πR²σT⁴, where R is the radius, T is the temperature, and σ is a constant. If R is increasing at 100 km/year and T is decreasing at 1 K/year, find the rate of change of L for a star with R = 7 × 10⁵ km and T = 5800 K.
   
   **Solution**: Using the chain rule for multivariable functions:
   dL/dt = (∂L/∂R)(dR/dt) + (∂L/∂T)(dT/dt)
   
   Computing the partial derivatives:
   ∂L/∂R = 8πRσT⁴
   ∂L/∂T = 16πR²σT³
   
   Substituting:
   dL/dt = 8πRσT⁴(dR/dt) + 16πR²σT³(dT/dt)
   
   With the given values:
   dL/dt = 8π(7×10⁵)σ(5800)⁴(100) + 16π(7×10⁵)²σ(5800)³(-1)
   
   The result shows how the star's luminosity changes due to competing effects of expansion and cooling.

3. **Question**: A telescope is tracking a satellite at an altitude of 400 km. When the satellite is directly overhead, it's moving horizontally at 7.5 km/s. How fast must the telescope rotate when the satellite is at an angle of 30° from the vertical?
   
   **Solution**: Let x be the horizontal distance from the telescope to the satellite, h = 400 km the altitude, and θ the angle from vertical.
   
   We know:
   tan(θ) = x/h
   
   Differentiating with respect to time:
   sec²(θ)(dθ/dt) = (1/h)(dx/dt)
   
   Solving for dθ/dt:
   dθ/dt = (1/h)(dx/dt)/sec²(θ) = (cos²(θ)/h)(dx/dt)
   
   At θ = 30°, cos²(θ) = (√3/2)² = 3/4
   
   Substituting:
   dθ/dt = (3/4)(1/400)(7.5) = 0.014 radians/s = 0.8 degrees/s
