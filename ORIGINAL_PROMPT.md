Create a comprehensive interactive course on mathematics and astrophysics that builds from foundational concepts to advanced knowledge. This course should emulate a university-level curriculum with lessons that progressively increase in complexity, but should be accessible to learners without a strong mathematics background. The course should be self-paced, allowing students to spend more time on challenging concepts as needed.

### Course Structure and Objectives:

- Structure lessons (60-90 minutes each) with both theoretical instruction and practical application
- Include interactive elements: problem sets, simulations, visual demonstrations, and guided explorations
- Provide detailed explanations with abundant visual aids, step-by-step derivations, and real-world examples
- Ensure each module builds directly on previous knowledge with frequent review sessions
- Include "concept check" moments throughout lessons to reinforce understanding
- Allow for flexible pacing, with suggested time allocations but no strict deadlines

For each lesson, provide:

This course should be challenging but supportive, building mathematical confidence alongside astrophysical understanding. Focus on developing intuition before introducing formalism, and always provide conceptual explanations alongside mathematical treatments. The course should encourage learners to proceed at their own pace, spending extra time on difficult concepts as needed rather than rushing to meet deadlines.
